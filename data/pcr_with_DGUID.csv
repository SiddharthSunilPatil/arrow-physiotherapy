Mississauga,ChIJkZx3yb1DK4gRU2szteXkKgc,Smart Physiotherapy Clinic,Asif Mahmood,1,"Awful experience in all respects. I booked for physio via phone for 2pm today. When I reached around 2pm, door was locked. I saw a lady sitting inside, so I knocked at the door, she opened the door and said “we are already closed for the day as there is no person to provide the service – although normally we close at 5pm”. I insisted that I will wait as there are still few minutes left in 2pm. She said there is no one to provide the service, all staff is busy and she has been fired from the job as she demanded for her salary, and owner instead of paying, fired her. Meanwhile, another lady came from inside; I asked her about my appointment and she said if I can come after 45 minutes. I came back after 45 minutes, and she asked me to pay 45 CD - that is what I was told over the phone. Massage room was dark and sheets were smelling; however on my request one sheet was changed. Massage was fine. After massage I came to the reception and asked for receipt of money paid. Receptionist informed that she charged me for the cash rate and if I need a receipt I will need to pay 94 CD – that is the rate for the insurance customers. I was surprised how come they refuse to give receipt. Anyway, not a good experience overall.

Mississauga,ChIJkZx3yb1DK4gRU2szteXkKgc,Smart Physiotherapy Clinic,Newmar Orders,1,"Yelp has my full review but here's the gist:

DO NOT COME HERE

The masseuses here are all terrible and non-verbal about solving your pain. The only good masseuse is Emilia, who my mom had as a masseuse and she was so professional, knowledgeable and really helped with the back pain.  I've had 5 massages here otherwise and all of them have been mediocre, with the exception of Dipti (perhaps the spelling is off) who is THE WORST. She must be related to the owner because otherwise I cannot see her being a trained massage therapist. So painful in places and then no pressure at all in the places that actually matter! And she will drown your body in oil so unnecessarily.

Reception is rude and unhelpful. They were 25 mins late for my massage that I had an appointment for. They lied and said there wasn't a double massage room which wasn't true, and then tried to make me and my mother go in at separate times without telling us that was the case. Iv'e called here multiple times and they must forget the name of their business 80% of the time because they answer with Hello?

Management is awful in so many ways. To their customers and to the employees.

Emilia is way too good for this place! Even though she's so great I will never be back to give these people my money.

I thought the owner must be more involved in running a better business because they respond to their reviews (besides yelp) but check out the below reviews for an example of management problems, every 5 star review gets a 1 hour free massage and people who shared a bad experience get 30 minutes.

MUV Therapy is truly outstanding, and Nadir deserves immense praise. After a back injury landed me in the ER, I was incredibly fortunate to find this clinic in Mississauga.
What sets MUV Therapy apart is their dedication to actually resolving the issue, not just offering temporary relief. You won't find time-consuming ice packs or machines here. Nadir swiftly pinpointed the root cause of my pain and began targeted, effective treatment immediately. I was back to feeling great in just two sessions! This speaks volumes about his expertise and the clinic's efficient approach.
Nadir is not only a highly skilled therapist but also deeply professional and empathetic. He genuinely cares about his patients' well-being, taking the time to understand your specific situation and craft a personalized plan that works. If you're in Mississauga and struggling with pain or an injury, I wholeheartedly recommend Nadir and the MUV Therapy team. They are truly dedicated to helping you regain your movement and quality of life.",1748372563,4 months ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

The moment you walk into the treatment center, the reception team makes you feel at home and at ease with their warm smiles and beverages. Then, the practitioners are second to none. These are teams of professionals trained under the McKenzie method, which is holistic, in layman's terms: You are unique and the center of the care and attention. I will highly recommend this Therapy center. My therapist today was Ty, and he is incredible. I feel much better after just one session and am better informed about how to improve my condition quickly.",1749582457,3 months ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

From the warm kind welcoming reception to the professionalism of the team. Nadir is extremely knowledgeable in the techniques he uses. He is patient and wants to see his clients get back to normal body movement without pain, and it shows. His methods are easy to learn and easy to do at home on your own!

I am 46 and have suffered from chronic back pain for almost 15 years. I was also was in a car accident a couple years ago, which affected my neck. I have seen different practitioners over the years and tried what I had thought was everything, until I was introduced to Nadir and his team! Within a few weeks of treatment I was noticing major improvement in my back, hip and neck pain. The work I have to do on my own for my recovery is extremely easy and doable. After noticing improvements I see how his techniques work and now if I don’t have the best posture or I start to feel some of my old pains coming back, I go right back into the stretches I was taught at Muv Therapy and I get the relief I need.

For the first time in years my body feels great and I never thought I would say this but my pain is mostly gone!

I can’t thank the Muv therapy team enough for helping me when I thought this was just going to be how life is with constant back and neck pain.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

If you are looking for relief and you think you’ve tried everything. Give Muv Therapy a try before giving up hope. I don’t regret it for a second!

Mississauga,ChIJAytR501BK4gRX61wnLE5-II,Oneness Massage and Physiotherapy,M K,5,"10/10 recommend, and I've been coming for 5+ years! At first, I tried it out because of proximity, but now I'm so glad it's close by, because it's worth the drive over!

Reasons why I highly recommend:
- clinic is simple and clean
- plenty of free parking space in the plaza
- Oneness charges your insurance directly, so no need to pay for reimbursement
- washroom available if need be
- calls you the day before to confirm your appointment, so you never forget/miss it
- always super accommodating with your appointments (I knew I would be a few minutes late today, and when I let David know, he pushed my session by 15 minutes - thank you!)

I book Marina Pak as my RMT and she's always in tune to your needs and check in with you throughout the session to make sure you're comfortable and doing okay. She applies the perfect amount of pressure and I always come out feeling more refreshed and rejuvenated than before! When I expressed pain in my lower back, she gave me some printouts to stretching and building my core and glutes to support my lower back and they helped tremendously!

Oneness now offers fascial stretch therapy, which is like yoga, but the RMTs help you stretch while you keep your workout clothes on, and it's the greatest thing (also covered under insurance). Definitely give it a try to feel like you're walking on clouds afterwards!

I've tried other RMT clinics around Mississauga out of curiosity, but I always resort back to Oneness because of their fair pricing and how well they deliver on your paid time. Thank you, Oneness! Looking forward to my next session with you.",1742848697,6 months ago,2021S05075350516.08,5350516.08

I first saw Kyle for a massage, and he was so professional, welcoming, and really listened to my needs. He took the time to explain what he was doing, checked in to make sure I was comfortable, and tailored the session to what my body actually needed rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

He was honest enough to refer me to Anesto (osteopath), who continued my care with the same level of professionalism. He creates a warm and safe environment, and has a real ability to pull back the layers to get to the root of the issue while still making me feel supported and understood.

I have also been working with Trevor (chiropractor), who is fantastic. His assessment was thorough, and he took the time to find the root cause of my issue. I have been seeing him for the past month. His adjustments are gentle yet effective, and he always explains what he is doing before each step. He has a calm and reassuring approach that puts me at ease, and I leave each session feeling relieved and more confident in my recovery.

Today was my first time seeing Z (physiotherapist), and he was thorough, attentive, and encouraging. He took the time to assess my needs, explained the exercises clearly, and created a plan that felt tailored to me. I left the session feeling supported and confident about the next steps in my recovery.

Each of them brings their own expertise and compassion to my recovery. I really appreciate how seamlessly the team work together and how supported I feel every step of the way.

The overall ambiance of the cold plunge and infrared sauna is really nice. It feels really great on your skin to be in the sauna.

I had a bit of an issue which I will not dive into here, and I have to say that within 24 hours management called me and absolutely went above and beyond in terms of what they were concerned with and how it was dealt with. It was not my expectation for that to happen, but I must say I was really impressed with the accountability and Just the professionalism in this day and age that goes such a long way, especially in a time where customer service has kind of gone to the fritz it’s extremely refreshing to know that I chose a location that I’m hoping will be up to standards with Oakville and or Yorkville even if in Mississauga the next time I go.

My first time coming here was in October 2024 but today is my last time going back. I always book and come to all my appointments. Never rescheduled and I’m from Scarborough travelling to Mississauga where the clinic is. This past Sunday April 6th I called after 1:07 pm to see if they had any open appointments available for the same day with Paulita. Front desk women said yes for 4 pm on the same day on April 6th. At 3:11 I call to cancel which I never do due to a family emergency. I explained that this was an emergency and I wanted to cancel the appointment and even apologized. Instead of sympathy I was give disrespect. The front desk is arguing with me saying I HAVE to come into my appointment. I said I can’t because of my family emergency. She said no and that a gentleman called that morning for Paulita and now it’s too late for him to come because of my last minute cancellation. I told her I booked my appointment that afternoon after 1:07pm. Just 2 hours before my 4pm appointment so how could that be possible. I would like to add that I have booked appointments with this clinic and they would call me back a few days later trying to cancel my appointment to give it to another person. It happened on 2 separate occasions. Even though I booked first. To continue the front desk women said that I needed to come in. How embarrassing that I’m trying to cancel an appointment as I was dealing with an emergency. I told her I am canceling the same appointment I made 2 hours before and hung up to attend this emergency. 5 minutes later the same women called me back telling me if I cancel last minute again she would charge me. I have never cancelled before. This was my first time due to a family emergency. Imagine. I told her that her customer service skills and empathy was nonexistent for her to call me back and try to argue with me at a time like this. It was honestly disgusting. To avoid more back and forth I hung up again for the second time that day.

Let me tell you guys, she was heaven sent. She was able to accurately diagnose what my issue was and told me that I strained my ligament in my wrist which is common in athletes.

She worked with me to ensure I had the proper exercises to strengthen my wrist and get me back to being able to do what I love. My appointments were always on time. She always had a positive attitude. Super friendly, and we always have great conversations. After my wrist is completely healed up, I want her to take a look at my hamstrings.

After checking online, this was the only clinic open in the area at that time, so we rushed over.
One thing I really appreciated is that the clinic is open every day until 11 PM—very helpful in urgent situations. They have different sections for various medical needs, and I was able to take my baby to the pediatrician. Check-in wasn’t available online, but they have self-registration screens on-site, which made the process easy and fairly quick.
The wait time was quite long, but given that it was the only open clinic late on a Sunday, that’s understandable.
The only downside I experienced was the lack of an elevator for strollers. I had to take the stroller back to the car, which was a bit inconvenient.

Then I got chance to get appointed with Alleviate physiotherapy, the receptionist girl is so kind and helpful and she went out of her way to arrange appointments as per earliest convenience.

He explained each step, made me feel comfortable, and encouraged me throughout the process. Week after week, I saw real progress.

Prior to booking, I called to inquire about the Groupon promotion for a 60-minute massage with a 30-minute reflexology session. I was told by the receptionist that I did not need to purchase through Groupon as they would honor the same price directly. I also asked for clarification on what reflexology included, and she explained it was a foot massage. Based on this information, I proceeded with the booking.

When I arrived, the massage therapist began with the foot massage. The session itself was very underwhelming—it felt more like light rubbing than actual reflexology. I asked for firmer pressure, but there was no noticeable adjustment. To my surprise, at the end of the foot massage the therapist stated that the service was complete. I explained that I had also booked a full-body massage, but after some back and forth, I was told that it could not be accommodated that day.

At checkout, I reiterated my concerns with the receptionist, but unfortunately the issue was not resolved. Overall, I received only part of the service I booked, and the quality of what I did receive was disappointing (approximately a 4/10).

For future clients, I strongly suggest confirming exactly what services will be provided before booking, to avoid the same misunderstanding. Unfortunately, due to this experience, I will not be returning.",1757107365,3 weeks ago,2021S05075350528.43,5350528.43

I called this place who denied seeing any charges. When I gave them the out by saying did you bill it by mistake on my plan for someone else, they said yes wnd that they would ""reimburse"" it. Which means they could see the charge and they lied. I told them to reverse the claim since I hadn't been there for years, and then delete my insurance from mt file. They said they would but not holding my breath. Super sketchy to think because I'm not coming in anymore I must not be using the benefit so they make the claim anyways. How dare they take from someone's benefits for services not rendered..not only is it insurance fraud but their scam takes away from the patient's allowances on the plan for coverage they need. Shame.

Update: Clinic made every attempt to rectify the error including contacting my insurance and reaching out to me with an update. Still frustrated that they refuse to anonymize my file after repeated requests to remove all my personal information, saying they keep records for 7 years from date of last visit.

It’s not your typical 10 min weekly crack he does. He will go and work on the root cause and try to fix you so you don’t have to come back. But he’s making such good results that might as well work on other parts that need some care as well.

Receptionist work really well around your schedule and always text you a day before to remind you of your appointment’s and if you’re able to attend. Since this has been my first ever accident and ever going through all of this, I always have questions for Iryna & she is always a text away for any questions or concerns I may have.

Nina, another receptionist is always willing to write down my appointments on a sticky note and or text me my appointment for me when I book them.

Natalia is the osteopathic masseuse, who always greets you with a smile and is very knowledgeable at what she does. Even though her practice isn’t like a massage at a spa, she makes the experience very relaxing with music and asks you before starting where you’re experiencing pain.

The physiotherapy Doctor , is very knowledgeable and also asks where you are feeling pain to work in that spot, that session. Uses a shockwave machine on the spot that is causing you pain, uses bio freeze to help with the pain and gives you helpful exercise tips, to do at home.

I highly recommend this clinic as you will be treated as family and treated highly with care.

I went in with a painful arm, and with her expertise and personalized treatment plan, I’ve seen such remarkable improvement. Each session left me feeling stronger, more relaxed, and with significantly less pain.

And I can’t forget about her massage room—it’s like stepping into a peaceful oasis. The soothing ambiance, the calming music, and the soft lighting instantly make you feel at ease. It’s the perfect environment for a healing session. Every time I walk in, I feel my stress melt away, and I can completely unwind.

My go to RMT is Ivana and if I’m not mistaken, she has background in traditional Chinese massage. The first time I went to Ivana I felt a level of relief I thought was going to be unattainable. I hold so much of my stress in my body that sometimes even the slightest massage can be painful. Ivana will seriously send relief through my entire body – her hands are made of magic! She gets so deep into my pressure points too which I really appreciate as that is something I usually have to ask for – I was pleasantly surprised when I realized Ivana listens to your body and will ensure to take action to correct whatever you are feeling.

My physiotherapist at this location is Peter. He is such an incredible person and physiotherapist. You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does; he truly cares to see his patients leave feeling better than when they came in. What I enjoy most about Peter is that he will always make sure you are comfortable being in his clinic, he will assess your entire body to see what other areas may be connected to your discomfort, he will massage the area, he adjusts as needed, he uses acupuncture relief (the best!), and he will even do chiropractic work as needed. In the middle of our sessions, I often can’t help but thank him because the relief always feels far better than I imagined before going into my appointment.

Thrive Physio is a prime example of how all of the little things make the bigger difference/impact on a person. I truly cannot express or show enough appreciation to everyone at this clinic.

Thank you for reopening my eyes to physiotherapy as well. For years I only stuck to chiropractic treatments as I felt I never “needed” physio – but the results and the relief my body feel would definitely beg to differ! :)",1682613865,2 years ago,2021S05075350520.01,5350520.01

I was feeling defeated, coming to terms with accepting this would be my normal moving forward as I had tried other modalities of treatment that did not work.

Within one session I had recovered entirely. I had full movement and sensation return. I continue to see Lokman regularly for maintenance as he is an excellent practitioner.

My physiotherapist  told me that although I was exercising frequently, there was not enough focus on my core strength. I had persistent hip tendonitis, and it was becoming a serious mobility issue.

I am not the most coordinated person on earth, and Reformer Pilates looked scary and intimidating. I had done mat pilates classes at the gym, but it was very difficult working around my injuries. I started at Kaizen by investing in 10 private lessons (with Kathryn, who was wonderful) to work around my injuries, and to learn the basics of pilates and using the reformer. Having that foundation set me up for success in group classes. The group classes are small, where the instructors know everyone’s limitations, actively providing safe alternatives. All of the instructors are great, but my favourite instructor is Wendy. Every single class is incredibly challenging and different, but I always feel safe with Wendy’s careful eye and modifications.

Two years later I continue Group Reformer Pilates classes twice a week. At 56, I have zero pain in my body and continue to improve and level up my fitness

I’ve also used Kaizen for their Physiotherapy services. A true one stop shop for all things mobility!  Thank you to Sanil and Priya for your physiotherapy services, and to Sharon for your friendly assistance on reception.",1735572700,9 months ago,2021S05075350225.02,5350225.02

Sanil was fantastic at treating me, very honest and very knowledgable. He was great at answering questions and explaining everything to me in a way I could understand.

The front desk staff, Mary and Sharon, were also so kind, funny and great at making sure I felt comfortable.

Michael, Parisa and Binal have been so caring and supportive throughout my journey back to recovery and I am truly grateful for all of them. Working as a frontline worker comes with a great amount of physical and emotional stress that came full circle when I was struck by a moving vehicle back in April 2025. After going through this experience, I had internal injuries going on but thankfully nothing on me was broken.

After a quick Google search, I found GHP Clinic (well...it found me😌) and my road to recovery began. Michael made me feel heard, seen and truly cared for. Parisa and Binal have been very supportive of me as well; asking questions like the scale level of pain I was experiencing each session, pushing me to do all of the required exercises, stretches, and even giving me small cups of water when I was thirsty. Moving forward, they all understood how physically hurt I was, but once I admitted to them that it became more emotional for me, they all reminded me that GHP is also a safe space. I will never forget coming to GHP clinic and working with people that truly care about their clients. They've truly made a difference and I would recommend anyone who's been in a traumatic situation or is hesitant upon going to GHP clinic to go. You will not be disappointed💕✨

Mississauga,ChIJKZ84_q43K4gR9dsGFC6DG1U,CBI Health - Toronto Islington,Natalia Reznikov,5,"I had been treated at CBI Health Islington for several months, and they became almost like a family to me: Theresa at reception, always with a smile, Harun, Saba, Tyler, Simaran. Their skills and professionalism are exceptional, and I really mean it, but what was even more important for me - it’s their attitude and readiness to go above and beyond for their patients. Every single specialist I had been working with treated me as if I were their baby, with gentleness and patience I really needed, especially in the beginning. I came there in a pretty bad shape, being on LTD for almost a year after a spinal surgery, not really believing that I would ever feel better, and I had to work hard to get to where I am now. Without the amazing CBI team that would have never happened, and I am really grateful for that.
The clinic is very conveniently located, right next to the subway, the gym is very well equipped and air-conditioned, and you have your personal coach, Harun, who is always there for you to support, to explain, to gently remind that I should do my exercises at home as well, to tell a joke and laugh with me. I will miss you, Harun, I will miss you all!
I would certainly recommend this clinic to anyone who wants to get a result for their money, while being treated with respect, friendliness and warmth that many of us don’t receive enough in real life

Mississauga,ChIJ2YWxGSg4K4gRmTUEZl-LGhM,Four Seasons Physiotherapy - pt Health,I Ks,1,"Government should not include this place as one that they fund for seniors. In fact it should be investigated and shut down entirely. My elderly parent came to this place post surgery. I accompanied and what I witnessed should be illegal. We were taken in for a consult; we were told that my parent could only get 3 therapy sessions with the “pt” (NOT TRUE)  but could get 6 with “assistant pt” we chose the 6 sessions as far more were needed for recovery. When we came for the sessions my parent was given a paper with exercises on it and was quickly shown the exercise and the “assistant pt” went to lie down on therapy bed behind the next curtain to scroll her phone. Eventually she’d come back, show another exercise and immediately disappear again, she spent zero time observing to see if exercises were performed correctly (this is crucial to pepper recovery). After 2-3 exercises (about 15 minutes total visit) she would come back and say ok, you’re done for today. I was in complete shock and disbelief. I panicked for my parent’s recovery. We ended up finding a proper physio place to ensure full recovery.

To anyone looking for a physio clinic, avoid this one like a plague. They think no one knows what getting physical therapy should look like, and of course because government funds it they think they don’t need to do the work they are paid to do. I have received plenty of physio to know what a proper physio session should look like.

PS. Do not believe the 5 star  reviews, they can’t be real; Probably done by their friends.

My responses to the reply below; i never said that my parents was my mother. No need to contact you, the review here is as detailed as you’d get if we spoke. I have had enough physio therapy sessions myself to know what good, bad and completely inadequate session looks like. This was scary inadequate and should not be considered physical therapy. It didn’t happen once, but every single visit.

Mississauga,ChIJ-V8EV0xHK4gRzDaZtXaZ3rQ,Healthier Living,Rajan Purba,5,"My time at this clinic was exceptional and uniquely different from others who have written reviews here. I'm a 3rd year kinesiology student from the University of Guelph-Humber doing my practicum here - seeing how Mira and the other doctors do their treatments has provided me with a lot of insight I want to share with others that may be interested in their services from a students perspective.

As a KIN major, I understand anatomy and biomechanics quite well. In addition, I'm also a professional Certified Personal Trainer and aspiring advanced health professional. I bring this up because as a professional member in this industry, I'm always learning and gaining more experience. Prior to my time here I didn't even know what osteopathy was. I figured it was a pseudoscience (meaning not a real science) and would be a useless therapy for anyone interested - I was wrong to think so.

Mira has a bubbly and unique personality that has made me feel very welcome to the clinic. She is a great mentor and teacher, stern at times but always looking to better my development. Despite her busy schedule, she takes time to answer any learning questions I have, urges me to shadow clients and help me develop skill sets by applying my current knowledge. She is extremely knowledgeable and it's truly incredible how much she knows. As I spend more time here at the clinic, I have seen incredible turnarounds of client/patient conditions than other clinics I have been to. In my first 2 weeks I have seen someone go from not be able to perform basic movements like squeezing their hand to make a fist to fully gripping a water bottle and drinking it no problem - something straight out of a movie but this isn't an exaggeration. The improvement to many clients/patients quality of life has since turned around my disbelief in osteopathy practice and to add; being able to connect what I have learned to Mira's practices reinforces this.

To make it clear, Mira doesn't know what I have written about the clinic and none of this has been reviewed by anyone - this is a genuine review. Mira truly cares about her clients/patients and I have never felt that she, unlike many other clinics, are scamming you. I have never felt that she wants to take peoples money or waste their time. She collaborates extensively with other doctors here, Dr. Gerus for example, to truly cover their 3 pillars of treatment: physical, chemical and mental - to get a full pictures of your issue, which is a really big part in how people are being treated so quickly (obviously the clients/patients need to also do their part in treatment too at home).

I think this clinic is great and it's genuinely been a wonderful experience for me as a student volunteer. There's a lot of value coming to this clinic as a client/paitient as I can vouch for her practice to be truly effective because it just makes sense compared to others. In the future, if I ever end up needing treatment for something, she and her team would be who I go to. I highly suggest you do too.

Thank for everything Mira and team!",1743118108,6 months ago,2021S05075350513.02,5350513.02

I am one of millions of patients afraid of acupuncture because of the pain pain or the possibility that a wrong place may be struck. In previous experiences with other acupuncturists, I would tell them that I’m experiencing pain during the treatment and they would immediately stop because they lacked confidence in their methods. However, Michael is the complete opposite because he solidly believes in his acupuncture skills. Even when I experience pain during his sessions, I’m reassured by Michaels knowledge that the pain is necessary in order to heal. He's incredibly professional, passionate about his work, and is always thinking about the health of his patients. Through his sessions, I've learned that acupuncture can be an amazing tool for physiotherapy, even inspiring me to learn more about it on my own time. He's also always showing me new exercises I can do at home, or new tools that can help alleviate my pain, all of which are a testament to how much he truly cares.

Initially, I contacted this clinic via telephone in March 2025 with a concern regarding pain in my feet. Dr. Ramsackal was extremely pleasent to speak with. She addressed my concerns by telephone at the level of someone who possess outstanding customer service skills. She must have spent 15 minutes discussing my concerns. I could ""feel"" the sincerity within her to treat my feet pain at her clinic.

I booked an appointment with the clinic the following week. Dr. Ramsackal was forthright from the beginning about the treatment process and the necessary medical equipment needed for a full recovery (i.e. orthotics, and compression socks).

While presently undergoing chiropractic care, I concurrently am seeking physiotherapy care with Asmita. I can testify that Asmita is an amazing physiotherapist with outstanding skills to treat my pain. After only 2 weeks of theraputic exercieses prescribed by Asmita, I observed a significant reduction in the intensity of feet pain. To this present day, I visit Asmita bi-weekly for ongoing maintenance and preventative care (to mitigate the risk of symptom recurrence).

I harbor a steadfast stance with my testimony about Innova Integrated Wellness Centre. I foster a strong supposition that anyone who attends this clinic for any pain will be looked after well. Awesome job!!",1753715508,2 months ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

Over time, the consistent relief and balance these treatments have provided—whether for stress, pain management, or overall well-being—have made acupuncture an essential part of my wellness routine.
The practitioner’s skill, intuition, and dedication are truly exceptional. They take the time to understand where I’m at physically and emotionally, adapting the treatment with care and precision every single time. I’ve come to trust this process deeply, and I always leave each session feeling renewed, restored, and more in tune with myself.

He did a physical exam and told me I have tension in my neck and I also have neck lines/wrinkles due to aging. So he started to push on both sides on the front of my neck - I'm guessing trying to do a ""myofascial release"". I told him that it was too much pressure, he eased off a bit but still continued to press on my neck for next minute or so. After I got off the table, I felt little dizzy. The following day I noticed I have pain when swallowing food and drink and tension on the left side of my neck where Justin pressed. That pain significantly increased in couple days. I had to go to ER where a doctor diagnosed me with neck muscle strain and spasm! I contacted the clinic and told them what happened, at first they were apologetic and offered a free sessions with physiotherapist to help me with this injury recovery. Later I found an article that stated that myofascial release should never be done (specifically with sustained deep pressure) on the neck, stomach and any injured areas. Also my chiropractor and another myofascial physiotherapist told me that they never treat and apply any pressure to the front of the neck due to many blood vessels, lymph nodes and nerves going through that area. So I sent this article to Justin to warn him of the dangers that his releases might cause to patients. Couple days later I received an email from Justin telling me they are discharging me as a patient!!! I could not believe it! What an awful way to treat a client who they injured!!!

Joelle was very methodical in eventually determining that my hip and lower back were also contributing to my knee issues.

I would highly recommend Joelle; she's very knowledgeable and made sure to explain her approach as she went through it. I especially appreciated her professionalism and empathetic approach, as she takes the time to understand the client's goals as well.

She’s not only knowledgeable but also very personable and compassionate. She always took the time to explain what was happening with my body and helped me truly understand my pelvic floor—something I hadn’t expected to learn so much about! Her approach made me feel comfortable, heard, and empowered in my recovery.

Thanks to her guidance and care, I’ve made it back to pretty much my baseline. I’m so grateful for everything she did to support me through this process.

I met with Ivan Wong, who asked me a few questions but did not provide any meaningful guidance on my condition which clinically diagnosed by my family doctor as cervical radiculopathy. There were no posture correction tips, no explanation of possible causes, no suggested stretches or exercises, and no clear next steps for managing or improving my issue.

During the session, he performed a few movements and then placed a massager on my back for about 10–15 minutes, which felt more like a temporary fix rather than real treatment.

I’ve had physio before but nothing has compared to the care and expertise Mohamed provides. He doesn’t just treat the problem, he takes the time to understand me as a whole person and that’s what makes all the difference.

What sets him apart is how invested he is in his patients. He notices the smallest details, explains everything clearly, and makes sure I always know why we are doing what we are doing. He celebrates the little wins with me, and when setbacks happen he is encouraging and positive without ever making me feel rushed.

Thanks to Mohamed, I am not only seeing real physical improvement but I also feel more confident and hopeful about my recovery than I have in years. His mix of knowledge, patience, and genuine care is rare to find.

I’ve been seeing Disha for over a year now, and honestly, she has been a lifesaver. I never really believed in physiotherapy until I met her.

I was struggling with severe issues in my hands (especially my thumbs). I couldn’t sleep, work, or function properly. After about six months of consistent therapy, I’m now 99% healed—it’s mostly just maintenance at this point. I started with twice-weekly sessions, then moved down to once a week, and now I only need to see her about every two weeks for my hands. I can’t put into words how grateful I am for the difference she has made.

More recently, I developed a Baker’s cyst behind my knee that left me in extreme pain. Both my family physician and a rheumatologist recommended physiotherapy, so of course I went straight to Disha. After just two visits, my pain has already reduced by more than half—I could hardly
believe it!

Disha’s expertise, care, and dedication have truly changed my life. If you’re in need of physiotherapy and looking for someone who is genuinely amazing at what they do, I can’t recommend her enough. I’m forever thankful for her help. 😌",1756498981,4 weeks ago,2021S05075350511.02,5350511.02

Mira's knowledge goes above and beyond the scope of her work. She is constantly seeking knowledge in other areas and she shares what she has learned. Her team of practitioners are all very welcoming and knowledgeable in their own ways.

The pain began in early November 2023. I tried anti-inflammatory medication, which decreased the pain but didn't make it any easier to go to work. A friend recommended Mira after she helped him with his back problem.

I stopped working, I started resting more, which helped, but nights were still difficult as I couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep. Coming to this clinic was the best decision I made. Mira didn't just focus on my knee; she addressed my whole body. She gave me exercises to do at home that helped strengthen my core and back. Gradually, I started feeling less pain and was able to walk, stand, and sleep better. I stopped taking painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication as Mira suggested.

What I liked best about visiting this clinic was Mira's holistic approach and her positive attitude. I had lost hope and thought the pain would be long-term. Her hands-on therapy was incredibly helpful, and I appreciated that she didn't use any machines.

To anyone unsure of whether to come to this clinic, I can say that I was able to walk, stand, and return to work in a short period, which felt almost magical.

I had suffered from back issues, neck and shoulder pains, headaches and migraines that stemmed from those aches and pains. Which all came from a bad car accident back in 2017. I have been to a couple chiropractors, physiotherapist, massage therapist, and their treatments never seemed to stick. It was more of a bandage fix, and nothing to help be rid of the stubborn issues I was still affected by, from that accident. After getting treated by Mira, I have never felt better!! Her techniques, her explanations and thorough care was phenomenal. I was honestly ready to give up any treatment before stumbling upon Mira and her team. But I am very grateful to have given their clinic a chance. Gaining my youth back, being able to RUN, feel my age if not younger again, is just something I can never thank Mira enough for. Mira, you gave me my life and youth back! There are not enough words to describe how great of a physician Mira is. 10/10 recommended, definitely book an appointment with her, and you'll receive a healthier life worth living, with PERMANENT results. Thank you so much Mira! It is bitter sweet that I don't get to see you anymore, but you're treatment has healed and given me more than I could have asked/hoped for. Forever thankful and grateful to you and you're services.

I would never recommend this rehab due to the terrible experience I had. The staff is highly unprofessional and seem more focused on taking your money, including your insurance, rather than providing genuine, quality care. The entire process feels more like a business transaction than a place for healing or recovery.

The receptionist is especially disappointing—she is not knowledgeable about her role, frequently making mistakes with appointments and paperwork. Despite this, she acts overly confident and comes across as rude and dismissive. Her attitude is not only frustrating but adds unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.

Moreover, the facility itself feels disorganized and chaotic. Communication between the staff is poor, resulting in inconsistent information being provided to patients and their families. There’s a noticeable lack of compassion, which is critical in a rehab environment.

If you’re looking for a place that genuinely cares about your recovery and well-being, I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere. This rehab is not worth your time, money, or trust.",1732206041,10 months ago,,

By far the WORST experience I have had in a medical facility. I am going there specifically for Dr. Noha as my children were registered there when this clinic opened. She is a great dr. who has helped us a lot when my 18 month old was diagnosed with Autism and a genetic condition. However, now we need a family dr. to reach her and it has been impossible to reach her.

I registered myself and my children with Dr. Hana Abu Yazid who is the most unprofessional and unempathetic Dr.  I have been waiting for a month to get my results and it is dead silence on her part. I asked for a gynae referral for myself as I have endometriosis and require proper medical attention for it. Every time I go there, she would not give me a referral. IT has been THREE long months and I’m still waiting. She is trying to delay the process of me reaching a gynae god knows why.

I had an appointment for my son who is non verbal and is facing some undiagnosed problems. She has not been of any help during the appointment and straight up pulled faces at me during the appointment!!!! I had gone to a walk in clinic when he had 104 fever and when I told her this she would say “you have been going to Dr.s outside of this clinic a lot and we don’t have any medical records”. I told her I could not get her appointment that day and could not wait in the waiting room for a good 2-3 hours with a severely sick child. Upon which she pulled out a face again. Do the Dr.s. at Intrepid not know how long we the patients have to wait in the waiting room??? I have previously spend 3 plus hours there once waiting for my appointment. The entire appointment was awkward where it clearly felt as if she does not want to help my child. It felt as if somehow my special needs child was a burden on her or undeserving of her medical advice because he cannot express or speak. Mind you, this lady was hesitant in touching my child and helping me calm him down.

These people are rude and unapologetic especially the front office staff. I’ve witnessed them making big mistakes in relation to customer records and appointments. Also, please be aware of the good Google reviews as they seem to have noticed that they’re getting bad reviews and have created some sort of lucky draw if you give them a Google reviews.

Mississauga,ChIJx9w27khEK4gR7UQoty_kZd8,Clarkson Sports and Physiotherapy,R Unninayar,5,"My experience with Clarkson Sports and Physiotherapy (CSP) has been par excellence. Over the past few years, other physiotherapists have treated my right elbow, but the issue has persisted. Fortunately, Megan fixed it for good, allowing me, a senior, to get back into the swing of things in the pickleball circuit. Megan is a consummate professional and very personable, which makes the world of difference to us seniors! My right knee has been on a similar journey, and thanks to Megan, it’s well on its way to recovery.
I would also like to commend the admin. team - Kelly and Tanvi for their patience, efficiency, and excellent customer service - one truly feels welcomed at CSP thanks to them.
Clearly, such a go-to culture starts with management. Meeting co-owner Dr Sheila Hubscher, who ‘walked’ me through a gait test and provided clear, informative and unbiased guidance, underscores this point. Kudos to the co-owners for fostering such an exemplary culture.
I highly recommend CSP and have already shared my feedback with several seniors, including those in my pickleball circle. Many thanks to the CSP team!",1758056557,a week ago,2021S05075350501.02,5350501.02

I’m grateful we followed Cassandra’s advice to continue until one year of age. While everyone around me kept reminding me that  babies develop at their own pace, these sessions gave me valuable knowledge about proper physical development for the future.

Nope. I spent 5 hours crying in the waiting room like a toddler who dropped his ice cream. Sitting was impossible, so I just stood there the whole time like a sad decorative lamp.

I’m leaving this review to warn others about the highly unprofessional and unethical practices at this workplace. I was told not to come in without any formal termination and after giving me offer letter. Later, the owner, Ravi Sran, personally called to appreciate my work—but when I asked for the payment I was owed, the story changed, and suddenly I was “terminated.” A convenient excuse to avoid paying for the days I worked. They blocked me from everywhere because I asked my full payment.

They now claim it was due to my Punjabi fluency, which is laughable considering they never clearly outlined any language expectations. In fact, during training, I was told we could speak in English if I was more comfortable. Using language as an afterthought excuse is just poor management and bad ethics.

The environment is extremely toxic. Owners constantly gossips about their own employees, calling them lazy and toxic behind their backs. The same people who blame others for negativity are the ones spreading it.

It’s clear why employees don’t stick around—this place doesn’t value honesty, professionalism, or basic respect. I don’t care to work here again, but I do expect to be paid for my time. This review is a result of being lied to, disrespected, and left unpaid—not a single doubt why turnover here is so high.

Mississauga,ChIJuW-N1UJCK4gRxnN7ReZLGpU,The Chiropractic Office & Health Associates,Nicole,1,"Came to this office last Wednesday, it’s now Tuesday and my back is completely messed up still after almost a week.

Called the office for an initial consultation and specifically requested a chiro that’s used stretches, TENS pads ect on my back as I have a lot of issues and tightness and was sceptical but was assured that was how the Drs here operate.

For some reason I was matched with an inexperienced chiropractor- Was treated by Dr. Garritsen and honestly I thought a lot about if I should leave this review or not but I genuinely just don’t want others to go through the pain I have been going through this last week. It has been a horrible experience. If you have alot of neck/back pain I don’t recommend coming here because you will leave in more pain than ever before and regret the whole visit.

First of all this chiro seems inexperienced because she just twisted my neck and didn’t crack it and told me she “doesn’t crack people super hard the first time she meets them”, but then proceeded to crack my back harder than ever, without using tens pads or any exercises to warm up my shoulder blades or mid back. If you do not know how to crack someone’s neck why don’t you just avoid this area all together? It can lead to serious complications if you don’t know what you’re doing. She needs to be re trained in cracking someone’s neck because she can’t do it, and is not confident in herself. The experience was so weird and I felt like I was a practice run for someone who was still learning.

I have never had this issue with any chiro I’ve ever been to in my life and I’ve been to a few different ones.

Now I have to focus on rehabilitating my back over the next few weeks and like I said, very inexperienced and I do not recommend this clinic, avoid at all costs or at least avoid Dr. Garritsen.

And no I do not wish to call the clinic or talk about my visit as you can see this is how I feel and now nothing can fix the experience other than me seeing someone who actually knows what they are doing to fix my back. Please re train your chiropractors that’s all I wish for so no one else has to go through this.",1753819449,2 months ago,2021S05075350516.08,5350516.08

My husband and I had been feeling extremely sick for 15 days after traveling abroad, trying various over-the-counter medications without relief. When we visited Dr. Seif, she completely disregarded our symptoms. Instead of focusing on our health concerns, she started sharing personal stories about how much she dislikes snow and wants to travel.

Despite our repeated attempts to explain our condition, she simply dismissed us, stating that “everyone in Ontario has it” and offering no real diagnosis. She gave us inhalers, suggesting we had asthma, but provided no further explanation or treatment. As our condition worsened, we sought help from another clinic, where the doctor diagnosed us with severe bronchitis from travelling we mentioned we travelled she said so what.  The other clinic prescribed antibiotics, sprays, and additional inhalers which provided a lot of relief and dr Mona said our chest was clear whereas the other clinic doctor said we were very severely suffering. We were both shocked by how Dr. Seif failed to properly assess our health and left us feeling dismissed and unheard and we could  have recovered and went back to work but she wasted one week of our recover time.

Great service and knowledgeable friendly staff. This year when I needed another pair of socks I also inquired about getting a pair of donning gloves as mine were worn out. I was told they were $60.00. ???? Amazon has them for about $19.00. There are online medical supply places selling them for $6.99. All brand name gloves. When I called again to ask if I possibly misunderstood the amount I was assured the price was right and was told “ if you can get them for less, that’s good for you”.
I ended up calling the place where I went for these services before and they have them for $11.00. In fact, my first pair were free with my original stockings at this establishment a few years ago.
Needless to say I bought them from them.
I can understand a bit of a mark up but $60.00 to me is simply criminal. Shame on Alliance for this blatant price gouging. There should be a law against this sort of thing.

Angelito is amazing. He asks questions, listens, and remains focused on finding the root cause. Before proceeding, he’ll explains the problem, provide the solution(s), and gets to work to correct it. His comprehension of the bodies anatomy is far beyond ANYONE I’ve ever encountered in his field (Pssst - he’ll be giving you exercises to do to correct your ailment(s). As the saying goes, God can move mountains, but you better bring your shovel!) Angelito will also tell you he’s not out to schedule repeat sessions unless you don’t want to do the exercises. If you want to feel better, do what he says, then schedule yourself for tuneups if needed.

I enquired about shockwave therapy for my Plantar Fasciitis with Dr. Sam while waiting for my appointment as she was sitting at the reception desk. She told me it’s not a service they provide but said she would find me a source and email me. My first thought was, yeah right, I’m not even seeing you, why would you do that! Later that evening I received an email from her advising me of her find and gratuitously provide the information. That over the top experience, as well as my physical success with ACS, put this place light years ahead of other business with equal services.

I’ve worked with Catherine as well and she is an amazing massage therapist.

This team is always smiling and the facility is spacious and always very clean. They have Crocs at the entrance for you to change into upon entering. There’s even a Lysol can to disinfect those Crocs before you put them on and when you leave too! Another bonus.

Mississauga,ChIJQ4A8Jz9HK4gRzwBqSEdD81o,Avesta Physio Rehab Clinic,Alex Z,5,"If you suffer from tennis elbow, you may want to try shockwave therapy with Avesta!
I hurt my elbow last year. My doctor prescribed anti-inflammation pills and physiotherapy. Together with pain killer, icing and stretching, I tried a lot of solutions. Non worked for me. Finally A shot of cortisone eliminated the pain completely. However, about a month later, I don't even know what I did and suddenly the pain came back. as you may know, Cortisone shot has some serious potential risks which include tendon weakening and rupture. I wonder maybe it did cause some damage... That was early this year and I don't want to take another cortisone shot any more. so I suffered everyday and the pain would wake me up several times a night. Finally the specialist asked me to try  shockwave therapy and I come to Avesta.
After 3 treatments by Amir, I would say the pain is 60% gone!. Now I can finally sleep through the night! This is way beyond my expectation. If you suffer from tennis elbow, you would  know exactly what I'm talking about.  I have never wrote long reviews but I really want to share this. Oh, one more thing, when you take the shockwave treatment, expect some really excruciating pain. Once it's done, you will feel immediate relief.
I'm coming in for my 4th shockwave tomorrow. I'm very optimistic now.
updated Aug 24th:  total 5 treatments of shockwave by Amir, 75% pain is gone. only issue left is on the very bony spot which is too painful to take shockwave. I will leave it alone and start some exercise. Overall, shockwave therapy is very effective treating my tennis elbow. Thank you Amir!",1629822220,4 years ago,2021S05075350521.04,5350521.04

Mississauga,ChIJpVA22lFDK4gR8QjKCdmpBQg,Regenerative Health Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,Jacqueline Zonneville,2,"I’ve been dealing with debilitating, chronic pain since seeing Dr. Kings in May 2023, initially for help with tendon tears in my left glute. While he was quick to identify the tears in my left glute and hamstring and provide needed PRP treatment (which worked), I continued experiencing similar pain on the right side, which he dismissed and attributed to nerve issues rather than tendon damage. He did submit a requisite for a lumbar spine MRI and said he could be of no further help until after that. The whole time I knew the right side was also tendon related. So, after two+ years now of seeking treatment from various chiros, physios, etc. for both my spine disc issues and glute pain, I was finally diagnosed with tendon tears in the EXACT spot I flagged to Dr. Kings back in 2023. In the meantime, my right leg basically mummified in pain and restriction and my pain levels were consistently 10/10 (as a former athlete, I had to use a cane to walk last summer). Another sports medicine doctor has since started treatment with a series of PRPs, and I’m hopeful for recovery (since there are now a series of partial tears in my R glute/hamstring tendons and my body has gone through severe trauma so the mechanics are all impacted!). While Dr. Kings is clearly skilled, I didn’t feel like he truly cared about my well-being after addressing only part of my issues. I felt gaslit, unheard and left to navigate and advocate for myself. It’s been a long, frustrating and very painful journey, and though I considered returning to Dr. Kings for further care in 2024, I felt the treatment I needed was not fully addressed by him during our time together (or I wouldn't be in this whole mess). The toll this chronic pain has taken on my mental and physical health (and wallet) has been significant.",1748377666,4 months ago,2021S05075350612.10,5350612.10

Mississauga,ChIJ3y4ia681K4gRLGXpxGcN4QE,EW Bickle Centre for Complex Continuing Care,christine mcglade,3,"We had really high hopes for EW Bickle: after a very serious stroke and 2 months in toronto western hospital’s stroke unit, we were accepted into rehab at both Bickle and Bridgepoint.  We chose Bickle because we imagined that a UHN facility would offer the same calibre of nursing care as western.  This has not been the case.  The facility itself is clean and bright, with beautiful gardens and really amazing physio, OT, and speech language therapy staff.  The problem is that patients in low intensity rehab spend only about 90 minutes a day with these resources.  The rest of the time they are entirely dependant on PSW’s and nurses.  Many (most!) of the nurses and PSW’s have been  great, but there is no consistency in care.  They are clearly understaffed and we have had to bring a new nurse up to speed almost every other day we have been here as we have rarely had the same nurse twice.  The unit we have been placed in is new and we have had to deal with tons of ‘growing pains’ (the nursing managers expression, not mine) including refusal to transfer my partner out of bed and into a wheelchair more than once a day, waiting up to 40 minutes for a response to the call bell, and being berated by PSW’s after requesting basic caretaking like adjusting his position in his wheelchair.  Had we been told that we would be placed in a new unit that was still working out a viable staffing model, we would not have come here.  Because of the inconsistency in nursing assignments, we cannot rely on the staff to implement any of the recommendations the physio team have made such as using a slide to transfer my partner out of bed.  I sincerely hope that these growing pains work themselves out so that the nursing management lives up to the excellent rehab provided at Bickle.",1756841524,3 weeks ago,2021S05075350007.01,5350007.01

EW Bickle Centre I admit I skeptical because of the location and I know our health care system is having some challenges. The Ward rooms covered by OhiP are much better than the Semi and the private rooms at Runnymede.

The private room at Runnymede was too cold and no view. The semis seemed too tight. After both experiences I would take the Ward rooms at EW Bickle over the Semis and privates in a second. This place might be underrated, everyone even the patients seem very friendly.

There’s parking on the streets for an hour until 6pm then it’s good until midnight, you can also park in their lot, $10 for the whole day.

It’s clean, quiet, and I’m personally feeling a lot better about this place. I won’t post pictures although this wasn’t our first choice I’m glad this place turned out to be above my expectations.

Mississauga,ChIJ28u9yPZGK4gROBFiciY0_MI,Dynamic Physiotherapy & Sports Injury Clinic Inc,Dani,1,"Wouldn't recommend. I went there for treatment related to quite a serious motor vehicle accident. I have chronic back pain from a spinal fracture and migraines/headaches from a scalp laceration.

Most appointmentswith Kathryn and Robert lasted less than an hour, no one did any physiotherapy with me. Just used machines that aren't clinically proven to work, and made me ride a bike and bounce on a trampoline and lift weights. Where is the therapy in that??

I tried asking them about my joint pain from my hyper mobility as well. Asking if certain braces would help, and asking for exercises. But Kathryn seemed to pretend like she didn't understand. And when she ""did understand"" she said she couldn't do anything to help. ""There's nothing to do"". But now I've been referred to an EDS hyper mobility clinic by my doctor. It felt like she just didn't want to do her job.

They were also very unprofessional and had quite lazy behavior. They did maybe one or two good treatment sessions and then just decided to stop trying. And my treatment wasn't working.  I eventually just stopped showing up and they didn't even call to see why. They don't care about treatment. Just money. Robert was even complaining to me about my insurance not covering certain HST. That's your problem bud, not mine.

On top of that, it's only the two of them working there. Husband and wife, and sometimes their son. It's pretty strange, and the dynamic is weird. Like you can tell when they've had an argument that morning. I don't like this place at all, and I feel like there's something else going on there.

Mississauga,ChIJ28u9yPZGK4gROBFiciY0_MI,Dynamic Physiotherapy & Sports Injury Clinic Inc,Brandon,1,"The worst physiotherapy place I have ever been to. I typically am not the one to leave reviews (on anything to be honest), but I feel its necessary in this particular case.

To start - I scheduled my appointment online, and they called me on the day-of to re-book me for a different time slot that day. I didn't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with waiting an hour to see someone once I arrived at the clinic...

Once the physiotherapist entered the room, she rushed my diagnosis in the matter of 30 seconds or so, then attached these electrodes to my arm (A therapy which is proven to not have any scientific benefit by the way). Then when I asked to just focus on the root cause of the issue and what I can do to help it, she said they didn't have time to do a proper assessment and that I would have to come back at another time next week... Why should I have to pay for another appointment because they couldn't properly schedule me in the first time?? Also why do they not focus on the root cause of the issue in the first appointment?

The clinic is also not very well designed. Patient rooms are separated by curtains taken straight out of a hospital ER, so you can hear multiple people next to you and you have virtually zero privacy. I get the feeling this place is run like an assembly line, which the goal is to get people in and out as quickly as possible without actually helping them, and not addressing the root cause of their symptoms so they keep coming back...

After having this terrible experience they thankfully did offer me a full refund, which I took. I have recently seen a much better physiotherapist who was able to properly assess my condition, help me recover to the point where I am able to start playing baseball again!

Please, save your time and money and go to a different place.",1689646687,2 years ago,2021S05075350513.03,5350513.03
Mississauga,ChIJg5y57ylDK4gRk1pyts-m928,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Oakville South,andre bennett,1,"Worst clinic ever!!!! Went there hoping to get injections in my hips, shoulder and help with my knee. Because I had multiple issues, I had to get separate referrals for each body part I needed help with. This costed me many trips back and fourth from my doctor getting referrals. After that got taken care of I finally got my first appointment. Unfortunately they also need to make separate appointments for each body part as well (not all at once) which also required constant trips back and fourth. This issue with that is the doctors there only work one day a week, the other maybe twice a week. Also I should add their latest appointment I like 3pm. This caused me to miss lots of time at work leaving for an appointment and then going back to work. Which didn’t go very well with my employer. This went on for over a month with multiple appointments with both doctors and absolutely no treatment. Constantly went to an appointment and then got told to make another appointment to be able to go any further with treatment. Finally by the last appointment, I was very excited that I may finally get the treatment that I’ve been waiting for since I started going there. Because it was essentially my first appointment for this specific body part. I was told “you guessed it” that I had to make yet another appointment if I wanted to be treated! Completely frustrated at this point. I just sat there pretty upset listening to what the doctor had to say, said ok, then asked if I could leave. To which she said “yes”. This is where it really gets interesting! I later get a text message saying all my further appointments have been cancelled due to abusive behaviour towards staff. Shocked and confused, I called the office to ask what was going on? Was told by front clerk that the doctor (Dr Manisha Sachdeva) wrote in her notes that “I was not receptive to the information she was giving” and that “I walked out half way during the appointment”.  Don’t know how that constitutes as abusive behaviour. But anyway I immediately I went on to explain that I literally started doing the exercises that she suggested right after leaving the clinic and that I literally asked her if I could leave, to which she said “yes” and THEN I left. Sure maybe I was upset which I had every right to be. But I never showed her any disrespect, never said anything inappropriate, literally did nothing wrong! In fact, I told the person on the phone if anything I’m the one being disrespected in this situation. She went on to say “well you’ve been referred to another clinic, so deal
with them now” with absolutely no remorse. I replied with “ that’s fine I wasn’t coming back anyways, but please don’t say that I was being abusive. I literally did nothing wrong” she said Ok and pretty much hung up the phone on me. I know this has been very lengthy but I really needed to create the context. Do not waist your time with this clinic! I literally booked an appointment with another clinic already and have an appointment the next day with the promise of treatment. 24 hours as apposed to 5-6weeks. Athletes care DOES NOT CARE!!! Especially Dr Manisha Sachdeva. If she cared even a little, she would adjust her schedule to maybe an 11-7 or 10-6 shift so she can at least accommodate for her patients that work a 9-5 type job. Especially since she only works one day a week... NOPE! They expect you to take the time out of your job to accommodate their hours. Even if it costs you multiple times back and fourth with no treatment. WORST CLINIC EVER!!!",1758066153,a week ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

I came to the clinic after a spiral fracture in my left humerus and honestly the whole experience has been incredible. Right from the start Matt explained everything so clearly; the anatomy, what had happened, and how we were going to fix it. What stood out most was how well he listens. He doesn’t just nod along, he really takes in what you’re saying and then applies his knowledge to get you moving in the right direction. That gave me so much confidence in the process, and now I’m fully recovered. I’ve got my arm back, 100%.

The clinic itself makes everything so easy. Direct billing takes the stress away, the app helps you keep track of your program and log progress, and booking appointments (with reminders) is simple. On top of that, the vibe is welcoming and professional. Every visit I was greeted by name, and the whole team makes it feel natural, not transactional.

What really impressed me is how flexible and consistent the care is. I worked mainly with Matt, but also had a couple of sessions with Leah Terry, and the transition was seamless. It showed me that no matter who you’re working with, you’re in great hands — the whole team is knowledgeable, supportive, and committed to keeping your recovery on track.

Recovery here really feels like teamwork. They don’t just hand you a program, they adapt it based on how you’re doing and keep you motivated at your pace. The more effort I put in, the faster I got results, and they were right there adjusting and encouraging me every step of the way. They’re great at meeting you where you’re at and helping you move toward full recovery in a way that feels achievable.

Last year, I was working with Brian (physio), Trevor (chiro), and Sarah (chiropodist) for hip, knee, and foot issues. After receiving treatment for a few weeks and giving orthotics a try, I opted for further imaging which was diagnostic of a heel spur, plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinitis and arthritis in the knee.

I returned to Athlete’s Care earlier this year and in Brian’s absence, I started working with Lucky (physio). She has TRULY made a difference in my bodily mechanics. She is very skilled and knowledgeable, I would happily recommend her to anyone in search of a great physiotherapist.

2. They book me something for 5pm after months and then reschedule it on the day of the appointment, and when I say no, they mark it as a no show and inform me that the next time I come, I have to pay a no show fee.

3. Rescheduling to a different date is marked as cancellation and “no show” instead of rescheduled.

I’m very glad I had the chance to work with Phillip Park. The past 3 months, I had more than 10 sessions with him, I was impressed by how professional and knowledgeable he is.

The clinic’s location is also very convenient, which made the whole process even easier.

Mississauga,ChIJZdXEtG8tK4gRgtRhM6KcUPA,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Yonge & Sheppard,Irene T,1,"I've been coming to this clinic since April 2025 up until last month. The manager Jordan's handling of my last visit left a sour taste. I highly advise for everyone to TIME their physio treatment duration, as I paid for time I did not receive.

I had previously booked a couple 30-minute physiotherapy follow up sessions for $99. I saw there was an ""Extended"" option available for $130, so figured for cost efficiency, it made sense to book that, and expected an hour given that their assessment session is 1 hour billed at $129.

Come day of my appointment, booked for 1:30pm, my physiotherapist Reza (Mohammadreza) retrieved me from the waiting area 5 minutes late. I didn't fuss over this since I figure he would make up the time at the end of the session.

Treatment goes along fine. At some point as I laid face down on the treatment bed, Reza says my time is up. Confused, I look at my watch. It is 2:11pm, and I say I booked a longer session. He says I booked a shorter session and showed me his laptop that said my session ends at 2:10pm, but unfortunately he has a client right after and cannot treat me further that day. Understanding this is not within Reza's control and that there is a misunderstanding with pricing and duration, I got up and went to front desk, where I waited a few minutes for a receptionist to arrive.

While I waited, I sent a text to my partner complaining about the 35 minute session for $130. When the receptionist arrived, I reiterated my concern, noting that $99 pays for 30 minutes, so why is $130 only covering 35 minutes? For each extra minute, that's almost double the rate of the 30-minute for $99 session.

$99/30 = $3.3/min
$31/5 = $6.2/min

She was understanding and provided the manager's email to voice my complaint.

The same day within a few hours, I sent an email to the manager Jordan explaining the situation. No reply, so I sent a follow-up email 2 business days later. She then calls me and clarifies that $129 covers 1 hour for the assessment because there is more talking involved, but $130 is only intended for 40 minutes because there is less talking. I understand this, and provided her feedback that pricing and duration should be made transparent to customers since the extended physiotherapy option does not list duration either online or in person. I also informed her that the beginning of my intended 40 minute session had quite a bit of talking before actual treatment began and that my session started 5 minutes late.

She then mentions a potential discounted session. I want to make it absolutely clear at no point did *I* initiate any mention of a discount. She advised she'd need to confirm with Reza before confirming anything. I inform her this is fine but please reach out by email with an update since I work during business hours most days.

In the days that followed, Reza reached out by email about my treatment success, and I then follow up that I had not heard back from Jordan.

Here is where this *small and what-could've-been a simple solution of just giving me the 5 minutes I already paid for but did not receive* solution bubbles into something larger.

Reza emails me saying he treated me 8 extra minutes that day to make up for the lateness. I've attached the text message I sent at 2:15pm. Let's consider this claim:
1. I am laying face-down for treatment.
2. How can I be operating my phone at this time? Answer: I did not. It was in my bag. On the side. During treatment.
3. How is it possible that Reza extended 8 minutes that day if I sent my text message at 2:15pm? Answer: He did not.

I replied lengthily of my recollection of the events. He replied he will send my emailed response to Jordan and reach back out to me.

I've sent 3 follow-up emails to Jordan from August 6 to September 4. No reply. I've been pretty patient regarding what could've been a simple solution, and even my response to the false narrative.",1757554223,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350307.03,5350307.03

For more than a month, I could barely bend my lower back. Phillip Park helped me by setting up a thorough recovery plan to follow, as well as a plan to strengthen my muscles, which would improve my performance on the snow. He is always patient and supportive, and sent me the updated recovery plan & exercises after each visit. By following the plan, my back pain was significantly relieved after a few weeks, and I could start doing freestyle training again after about two months. His training plan also helped me build a strong, stable core and knees, which are essential for a snowboarder. With his help, I was doing even better in my freestyle training.

I'm not being bold when I say that the other do not come close to comparing. Yes, he's professional, empathetic, and has integrity, but those qualities are nice, but they won't heal you. What sets him apart is his knowledge and practice. He's a fellow, which means he has taken the time to invest in himself to further his schooling more than the average chiropractor, which means it ripples into your care. He knows what he's doing, and I came to him with a very complex case. I wholeheartedly, without a doubt, believe in his care and know that he's a bit of a hero.

My favourite part about working with Sandro was the fact that he consistently kept me moving forward in my progressi and constantly kept me motivated as well as challenged me with new exercises/more difficult exercises so that my knee could rehab faster.

By the end of the six weeks, not only was I able to play in a baseball tournament but I feel confident to do do my regular gym routine with no hesitation.

Mississauga,ChIJO0BWl6JBK4gR9smoqEkxPg8,Brittany Glen Medical Centre,Jas,1,"I took my son to Brittany Glen Medical Centre because he was really sick, and honestly, this was one of the worst experiences we've ever had with any healthcare provider. First off, the receptionist told us the wait time would be 45 minutes — fair enough, we were willing to wait. But that quickly turned into over an hour just to get into the exam room.

And it doesn’t stop there. After finally being called in, we were made to wait another 30 minutes in the exam room before the doctor even bothered to show up. No update, no apology, nothing.

Now here's the part that made this visit truly disgusting: My son explained in detail everything he was feeling, and he simply asked for a doctor’s note for school. The doctor dismissively told him “you’re fine, don’t worry, go to school” — as if he was making it up. Only after asking multiple times did she reluctantly agree to write a note — but only for 1 day, when he clearly needed at least 2.

What kind of professional gaslights a sick patient like that? The fact that she refused to listen or take him seriously was beyond unprofessional. And to make matters worse, they charged us $25 for a note — for what exactly? After we waited 2 hours and left without the proper documentation we came for?

Let’s not forget the rude, dismissive attitude from the girls at the front desk. Zero professionalism, zero empathy, zero customer service.

This clinic is a complete joke. The service is trash, the staff is disrespectful, and the doctor clearly doesn’t care about actually helping patients.

When I go somewhere, I don't share my opinion based on my first impression. I went for the second time today and was truly pleased.

It was a one-hour session, and I felt like the time flew by. Raquel first briefly discussed my pain and then immediately focused on the aches and pains I was experiencing. Her hands seemed to find the aching areas themselves. Her hands are truly healing. The atmosphere at Wintergreen Physiotherapy & Sports Medicine is clean, free of unpleasant odors and distracting sounds, and the room's dim lighting and gentle jazz music make it peaceful and far from the noise of the world.

I thank her so much and can't wait for my next appointment.

Nowadays, consumers read 1-star reviews first. I was going to give 1 star so everyone could read my experiences, but since no one had given Wintergreen a single star, I didn't. Of course, that was just a joke :)). Since 5 stars is the maximum you can give, I gave 5. If it were possible, I would have given 100 out of 100.

What truly impressed me, though, was his proactive and holistic approach. He didn't just focus on the immediate injury; he also took the initiative to connect with my trainer and orchestrate a physiotherapy and strengthening regime that has been instrumental in addressing some old injuries I've had.

It's been fantastic to go from dealing with an injury to feeling better overall and unlocking previous challenges – all thanks to Ehren's thoughtful and comprehensive care. Looking forward to getting out on the water and doing some slalom skiing this summer. On top of his expertise, he's also super friendly, which made the whole experience even better.

Mississauga,ChIJH09Q5Dk0K4gRJEtJgtOlbfM,Sports Medicine Rehabilitation,EH,1,"I visited this clinic today to address shin pain I have had on and off for 15 years. When I arrived, I was brought to see the sports medicine doctor, Dr Marciniak, who was currently receiving his OWN treatment, lying on a treatment bed. I am now receiving my appointment at his bedside while he gets his own treatment-no one seems to recognize that this is strange and inappropriate? He speaks to me for max 5 minutes about the shin pain (no background questions whatsoever) and then sends me back out to the waiting room to check if a physio/chiro practitioner can see me. While I am sitting in the waiting room, the doctor returns and says to me in front of other people present “Don’t be offended but we need you to lose weight. We can set you up with a diabetes specialist.” Please keep in mind I DO NOT HAVE diabetes, nor did we ever discuss that or anything remotely related to my weight. I told him I have had this pain since I was 14 when I weighed significantly less and he replied “Don’t be pissed off.” I was so upset and uncomfortable I walked out. I am not sure why this doctor feels entitled to 1. Receive his own  treatment while seeing a client 2. Speak about personal health details with clients in public settings, or 3. Immediately tell me my issue is to lose weight after a 5 minute consultation in which he asked zero questions regarding my weight or general health. I am absolutely astounded by the lack of professionalism at this business. Based on the other review in which he tried to sell someone Botox, I am assuming his business model largely relies on trying to upsell his clients. He would do well to remind himself he is a sports injury doctor and that it's unlikely people are coming to see him for his weight loss advice or Botox treatments. Potential patients can also note that Dr. Marciniak was reviewed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 2020 as “concerns have been identified with respect to his knowledge, skill, and judgment” resulting in him requiring clinical supervision and re-education.

Let me share my experience and the fantastic outcome I achieved through this treatment.
Before discovering PRP, I struggled with chronic joint pain and limited mobility, which had a significant impact on my daily life. Conventional treatments only provided temporary relief, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated and disheartened. That's when I came across PRP and decided to give it a try.
Dr. Minhas was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive throughout the entire process. He explained the procedure thoroughly and addressed all my concerns, putting me at ease before the treatment. The procedure itself was relatively quick and virtually painless, thanks to his skilled hands and comforting demeanor.
The magic of PRP lies in its ability to utilize the body's own healing properties. After drawing a small sample of my blood and separating the platelets, Dr. Minhas injected the concentrated PRP directly into my knees. The entire process took only an hour or so, and I was able to return home the same day.
Within a few weeks, I began to notice significant improvements in my joint pain and mobility. As time went on, the results only got better and better. Not only did my pain subside, but I also regained flexibility and strength that I thought I had lost forever.
I highly recommend Dr. Minhas and PRP therapy to anyone suffering from chronic joint pain or similar conditions. This treatment has brought about incredible results in my case, and I'm sure it can do the same for many others.
Thank you, Dr. Minhas, for your expertise, compassion, and for introducing me to the wonders of PRP.",1695055176,2 years ago,2021S05075350214.00,5350214.00

Mississauga,ChIJTW34noE2K4gR_6_5JEraSoc,High Park Physiotherapy,Mal Kau,1,"Dear High Park Physiotherapy,

I am writing to document and share my concerns regarding my recent experience at your clinic.

I first called on a Tuesday to book an appointment. I was asked if I could come in later that same day; however, I was unavailable and instead accepted an appointment for the following day at 1:30 p.m. I was very pleased to have been booked so quickly.

When booking, I explained to the receptionist that my family doctor referred me to High Park Physiotherapy specifically because your clinic accepts patients covered under Ontario Health Insurance. The receptionist informed me that OHIP-covered clients may have longer wait times compared to those with private insurance, and asked if I had private insurance. I confirmed that I do, through Desjardins, and she was pleased to hear this and confirmed my appointment.

I also explained that all services I receive should be billed under my Desjardins coverage, and that anything not covered could be billed through OHIP. I told her I would arrive early to provide my insurance information since she preferred not to collect it over the phone.

The next day, I arrived one hour early to give staff time to process my coverage. However, an hour later, another receptionist asked me to sign a document stating that I was required to pay $150 for the initial assessment, with reimbursement to come directly from my insurance company.

I explained that I had already confirmed with the previous receptionist that your clinic accepts direct billing, and that I had come early specifically so the coverage could be verified. At that point, I phoned Desjardins myself. A representative spoke directly with your receptionist and confirmed that I am covered 100% for physiotherapy. Despite this, I was still told I must pay upfront.

The receptionist even called Desjardins again, and they repeated the same confirmation: I am covered at 100%. Still, the clinic refused to honor the direct billing and would not proceed with my appointment unless I paid the $150 directly.

Shortly after, the Director introduced himself and explained that High Park Physiotherapy does not accept direct billing from Desjardins because the insurer has not reliably paid invoices in the past. While I understand the frustration this may cause a business, the repeated insistence that I pay out of pocket—despite my insurer confirming coverage multiple times—was both confusing and concerning.

In total, I was told no fewer than nine times that I had to pay directly, even after Desjardins had clearly confirmed otherwise. Unfortunately, I was unable to proceed with my appointment as a result.

I am disappointed by this experience and would like clarification from your office:

Why does High Park Physiotherapy not honor Desjardins’ direct billing despite the insurer’s confirmation of coverage?

Why was I not informed of this policy when I first booked my appointment?",1757367702,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350103.00,5350103.00

Dr. Minhas has been truly wonderful to deal with. Chiropractor Luke was also exceptional in the treatment he provided as well as his knowledge.

However this is specific receptionist was so unpleasant to deal with. Since I was in pain after the treatment, having to deal with someone who speaks in a demeaning tone feels hurtful.

I came in and saw Dr Galea in regards to getting the PRP injection in my other knee. Dr Galea was very honest with me and advised me not to waste my money as my knees are bone on bone and that the injection would not do much for me. The way he put it was you cannot grow grass on cement, because I am bone on bone and PRP is designed to aid in the healing and regeneration of soft tissues such as tendons, ligaments and muscles. Since I am bone on bone, there's nothing there to regenerate.

She's an exceptional physiotherapist: professional, deeply knowledgeable, and truly invested in her patients' recovery. Whether it's been a sports injury, recovery from surgery, or general mobility concerns, Daniella has consistently provided tailored treatment plans that deliver real results.

What really sets this clinic apart is the full team.  Every therapist and assistant I've interacted with has been welcoming, kind, attentive, and highly skilled. There's a genuine sense of collaboration and support in everything they do.  You never feel rushed and always feel like you’re in capable hands.

One of the most helpful aspects is that they always provide clear, practical exercises to do at home, which really accelerate the recovery process and empower you to take an active role in your own healing. You're not just treated during your appointment - you’re given clear, practical exercises to continue your recovery between sessions. These exercises are thoroughly demonstrated and explained, and they’re even emailed to you with video links to ensure you’re doing them correctly at home. This support has been a huge part of my progress, and it’s empowering to be actively involved in your own healing process.

Thanks to the outstanding care I've received over the years, I've been able to recover more fully, manage pain better, and stay active. I wouldn’t go anywhere else for physiotherapy.  I recommend this clinic without hesitation to anyone looking for top-tier physiotherapy care.",1752782953,2 months ago,,

I didn't get her name. I was there to talk about my medication.

She told me the side effect (extreme one's i dont even want to write it, its that BAD!) of the medicine and then i asked that every doctor i met has said this med is safest and effective (which she agrees as well). she also then confirms the probability of side effect occurring is 0.01 percent. My concern is why are you making your patient fearful? Instead of telling positive words why extreme side effects are being told that creates fear and demotivates.

I also felt pressurized since she asked so many questions verbally and on paper which I think is unnecessary as I was already taking meds before. This clinic has my history.

Instead, Dr. Iqbal started discussing diet and asked how expensive cigarettes are in Canada. I was genuinely shocked by the lack of urgency and clinical attention.

A co worker referred me to the Movement center , where I met Dwight. After 2 sessions of deep issue massage and several yoga body twisting exercise I was back to normal.

Fast forward to 2025 , I developed a nerve issue in my leg call “Sciatica “, I got mediation from the doctor that didn’t help , I drove 40 miles to a “Chiropractor “ that I was told was the best, 3 constant week of going twice per week not improvement, then I remember Dwight at the Movement Clinic. I called him and the next evening I was at his office , I walked in like a “DUCK “and as I explained to him what happened, he place his on my body and I knew exactly which muscle was contracting and causing the horrific pain. After a 1 hour session of exercise I walked out normal . I told him thanks a million times, I book two more sessions after and now I am ok.

This is what I appreciate about Movement clinic:
1. No pay parking.
2. Environment is clean .
3. Personalized “constant attention”.
4. The soft music.
5. Dwight”s Active listening ability.
6. He is gentle “ but those hand are magically “.

8. They are flexible with after work 5pm appointments.

Recommendation:
They offer a wide variety of service , however it’s not noticeable on the inside. It’s on the window but not inside . Please place the detail on the inside.

The latter became worse overtime that it would even radiate to my neck specially when I wake up in the morning. I enjoy my job a lot  but this type of pain holds me back from such activity until I receive chiropractic care by Dr. Brian and Physiotherapist Dr. Deepali

They were able to address them and I can already feel the improvement. I can now move freely without complaining about my shoulders being stiff after.

More so, these were not included in my issues as I came to Dr. Brian for chiropractic care but I have observed that my precious injury on my left knee is getting a lot better.

Healing is a process and it’s a two way effort. By religiously following the home exercises Dr. Deepali gave me plus following the scheduled adjustments to keep me on track with my care plan, I believe we will be able to attain my health goals.

However, looking at other reviews as well, there definitely seems to be a trend with the receptionists (not really a receptionist but another RMT whose name I know from your website) and their lack of friendliness.

Like another reviewer said, I had hardly entered and was immediately asked what my name was. No greeting, no welcome, no smile. This continued even after the massage ended & I came back to the reception for payment. It was like she had a problem that I was there. Didn’t even respond when I greeted on my way out. Just a don’t care attitude to be honest.  Hated the way she made me feel.

Sam is a genuine and caring practitioner. He is not doing this for money or fame, but he truly wants to help people.
If you're ever on the fence about trying Ostea treatment, give Sam a try. I promise that Sam will leave you better than he found you.",1758561367,in the last week,2021S05075350516.08,5350516.08

Sam is amazing.
Sam is awesome.

Can't say enough for the person.
I had a tennis elbow and have been crying in pain for over 5 months.
I have been to various doctors, physiotherapist and what not, but to no avail.
I meet Sma who helped my wife with her Sciatica pain. He helped when she had given up all hopes, Sam is just pure magic.
He helped her and we could instantly see the different.
I went to him with my elbow in pain and wearing a full Armour size brace.
By the end of the session I was moving my arm with no pain or fear.

Despite seeing numerous MDs, no conclusive findings were made.

Since I began treatment with Danuta, my pain has improved dramatically, dropping from a 10/10 to a much more manageable 2/10, and it is now far less consistent. With her guidance, I’ve been able to identify my triggers and take supplements accordingly. My treatments include biofeedback, colonics, and ionic detox, which have helped me significantly. I have also been able to mostly eradicate my Candida overgrowth.

I have been dealing with on and off symptoms of stress and anxiety alongside eczema flares for the past 2 years. After staying 2 weeks in the hospital this past summer fighting off a rare fungal and skin infection, the doctors were puzzled with how to treat me. My body was rejecting a lot of the antibiotics and I was breaking out into hives while the infections and symptoms were getting worse. It had gotten to a point where I was tired of treating my body with allopathic treatments and wanted to give my body a break from all the harsh medications I was put on (steroids and antibiotics). Shagufta has given me hope and strength with my healing through her naturopathy remedies. The care and empathy that she takes with her sessions alongside making sure that the treatments are a right fit for you are unmatched and something you will not find through our health system. After fully going through my case, the remedies provided have not only put my skin at ease with no eczema flares but also my mental health has improved immensely. These remedies have brought up the traumas I have suppressed for years and are now being released so I can finally heal naturally. Never thought this would happen naturally after I was told by doctors for years to just put on steroid/protopic creams.

I have been a client of Tracey Pleasec at The Chi Bar for over 10 years, and her exceptional care and expertise have always supported me through various health challenges. Tracey’s professionalism, knowledge, and genuine care set her apart.

Although I no longer live in the Streetsville area, I make it a point to return to her whenever I am in the city. Six years ago, I suffered from plantar fasciitis for several weeks, hoping the pain would heal on its own. Desperate for relief as the pain worsened, I called Tracey. She assured me she could help, and after just one one-hour appointment, my issue was completely resolved and remains so to this day.

More recently, I experienced significant pain in my left arm and shoulder blade, radiating down my arm with tingling in my fingers. After two visits with Tracey, the pain has decreased significantly and continues to lessen each day. Her ability to address the root cause of these issues is remarkable, and she always takes the time to share her knowledge, suggesting ways I can manage and prevent future flare-ups.

Tracey is someone I trust implicitly, and I highly recommend her to anyone seeking professional and effective care. I am so grateful to know her and to have benefited from her expertise over the years",1733616990,9 months ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

My husband and I came twice and one time we each had a great massage and another time, not so great. I have a concern about the “refer a friend” program. I made an appointment for my initial massage and sent a name for my friend who will come for a massage with me. I entered my name and my referred friend’s name in the system. Both my friend and I completed our massage and when it came time for us to pay, I was told the 10% off would be applied at our next visit. This doesn’t make sense to me as I came for a massage, and referred a friend as per the advertised program. Why was I not given the 10% discount once we completed our massage? So myself and my friend had to both make an appointment for a 2nd massage in order to receive our 10% discount. I am unhappy with the refer a friend program because it requires you and your friend to book 2 massages each in order to receive the advertised program special. If I referred a friend, which I did, then I should have been applicable for the program discount at the time of our completed massage. But I was not. I was told it was on my NEXT visit?!

she proposed to me an herbal remedy which I took not completely yet and while doing it my tongue already went almost all back to normal 85% I would say with the little I took so far, (I need to continue and finish all the tea. She can give you the remedy but we have to follow through with it as she will explain how to do it). But it is a worry less in my mind.

She really is an amazing doctor in my eyes. My point is to not be ashamed or to not leave any details when you go see her, be open and explain because I am pretty sure she will have a cure.

I was suppose to continue my acupuncture treatment which I only did 2 so far, because I lost my job and need to get that sorted first, but as soon as I can I will be back to her and cannot wait to continue healing along with her.
I write this review now because it has been on my mind and I want everyone who is seeking a real healing place in GTA to go see her, you won’t be disappointed. I am very glad I found her and she will be my go to anytime.

She reduced my anxiety tremendously and helped me let go of stuck emotions especially in my spleen area.
I hope anyone who is desperate or can’t seem to find the right person to heal them see this and try to go see her.

All the best Judy, hopefully I will see you soon again!
Take care.",1748909493,3 months ago,2021S05075350612.05,5350612.05

Judy Ye stands out as, in my opinion, the most professional acupuncturist in Canada. Her expertise was instrumental in addressing both my upper and lower back pain issues.

Moving away from Ontario, one of the most disheartening aspects for me was the inability to continue treatment with Judy. Her approach to acupuncture was not just effective but transformative in relieving my persistent back pain.

Judy's mastery in acupuncture is unparalleled, and the impact of her treatments on my well-being was remarkable. I sorely miss the quality of care I received under her guidance.

For anyone seeking top-notch acupuncture treatment, Judy Ye is undoubtedly the practitioner to trust. Her skill, dedication, and commitment to her patients' well-being are truly unmatched.

Every massage I’ve received has been not only relaxing but also highly beneficial. I especially appreciate that the staff take the time to understand your needs, they listen attentively, offer personalized recommendations, and check in throughout the session to ensure everything is going well. Special kudos to Mike and Robbie, both of whom gave exceptional massages that left me feeling noticeably better and completely stress-free.

The atmosphere at Atinama is calming and welcoming. As soon as you walk in, you’re greeted by a peaceful energy and a soft, soothing environment that encourages you to disconnect from the outside world and focus on your well-being. The relaxing music, often Reiki-style, enhances the experience, helping you fully unwind. They also offer water and other drinks, and there are books available to read while you wait, which is a thoughtful touch. The washroom is conveniently located and clean.

Overall, I highly recommend Atinama for anyone seeking professional massage therapy. The only minor suggestion I’d offer is regarding the oils used, some of them have a strong scent, which could be intense for people with sensitivities. If you’re sensitive or allergic, I recommend confirming the oil type with your therapist before the session.

Dr. Pires is one of the most humble, knowledgeable and professional chiropractors doctors I have ever met, especially in the city of Toronto. So far based on my experience with other chiropractors after many years of treatments and consultations, Dr. Pires was the only person who was able to help me until i underwent Lumbar Discectomy x 2. I have never been concerned about a negative review after the rest of patient's reviews give a practitioner 5 stars. Keep this in consideration and in mind, you will find your own answers.
Dr. Pires is real business and when it comes to patient care, you have gotten the best !
Stay healthy and confident!

After 1 month and 3 days post 2nd Lumbar Discectomy Surgery at L4-L5 level; Dr. Celia Pires patiently helped me perform the very first back stretching exercises!!! WOW She is absolutely skilled!!! I experienced NO PAIN or Sciatic during the exercises.
I AM SOOO HAPPPYYYYYY about it and to also know that so far everything seems to be going in the right direction!!!
I can not wait to be able to return to the GYM, OF course! on modified duties lol.
Thank you Dr. Celia Pires for existing in so many people's lives including me!
I HAVE BEEN BLESSED BY HER HANDS, EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE!!!

He explained each step, made me feel comfortable, and encouraged me throughout the process. Week after week, I saw real progress.

I’ve had physio before but nothing has compared to the care and expertise Mohamed provides. He doesn’t just treat the problem, he takes the time to understand me as a whole person and that’s what makes all the difference.

What sets him apart is how invested he is in his patients. He notices the smallest details, explains everything clearly, and makes sure I always know why we are doing what we are doing. He celebrates the little wins with me, and when setbacks happen he is encouraging and positive without ever making me feel rushed.

Thanks to Mohamed, I am not only seeing real physical improvement but I also feel more confident and hopeful about my recovery than I have in years. His mix of knowledge, patience, and genuine care is rare to find.

I can say without hesitation that Mohamed is the best therapist I have ever worked with and I would recommend him to absolutely anyone looking for outstanding care.",1757815532,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350601.00,5350601.00

It’s not even massaging, it’s just name sake massaging which is of no use. There is no such evaluation anywhere at any physiotherapy centres. Nothing but a waste of time n money. Went there in bad pain n they’ve done very little to give any relief. It’s mostly talking n delaying. Slight massage(wouldn’t even call it a massage)for around 30 mins which was an absolute waste particularly for someone in pain. Then 2 mins of namesake explanation of excercises which were not even explained well. Then 10 mins of IFT. That’s it. I could be a physiotherapist just to do this.

One of the standout aspects of this experience was how hassle-free everything was, especially when it came to dealing with insurance.

I met with Ivan Wong, who asked me a few questions but did not provide any meaningful guidance on my condition which clinically diagnosed by my family doctor as cervical radiculopathy. There were no posture correction tips, no explanation of possible causes, no suggested stretches or exercises, and no clear next steps for managing or improving my issue.

During the session, he performed a few movements and then placed a massager on my back for about 10–15 minutes, which felt more like a temporary fix rather than real treatment.

Overall, I left the clinic feeling overcharged and without any practical advice or value from the visit. I not only lost money but will now likely have to redo the initial assessment elsewhere to restart my treatment properly.",1758303652,a week ago,2021S05075350615.00,5350615.00

After multiple tests and finally an MRI, the root cause was identified — a pinched nerve due to issues in my C5 and C6 cervical discs. But even before the MRI confirmed it, Garima had already accurately suspected the issue based on her assessment. That level of experience and insight is rare.

Garima suggested a tailored physiotherapy plan that combined the right exercises with key lifestyle changes. Thanks to her treatment, my condition is now completely under control, and I’m on a steady, healthy recovery path. Her approach focuses on solving the root cause rather than just short-term relief, and her positive attitude makes every session reassuring and motivating.

She quickly identified the root cause and started the right therapy. What really stood out was how well she connected with him as a young patient — making him feel comfortable, motivated, and involved in his recovery. Not only did she help him recover fully, but she also gave him practical advice and exercises to maintain his fitness and prevent the issue from returning.

I saw a lady sitting inside, so I knocked at the door, she opened the door and said “we are already closed for the day as there is no person to provide the service – although normally we close at 5pm”. I insisted that I will wait as there are still few minutes left in 2pm. She said there is no one to provide the service, all staff is busy and she has been fired from the job as she demanded for her salary, and owner instead of paying, fired her. Meanwhile, another lady came from inside; I asked her about my appointment and she said if I can come after 45 minutes. I came back after 45 minutes, and she asked me to pay 45 CD - that is what I was told over the phone. Massage room was dark and sheets were smelling; however on my request one sheet was changed. Massage was fine. After massage I came to the reception and asked for receipt of money paid. Receptionist informed that she charged me for the cash rate and if I need a receipt I will need to pay 94 CD – that is the rate for the insurance customers.

Oakville,ChIJkZx3yb1DK4gRU2szteXkKgc,Smart Physiotherapy Clinic,Newmar Orders,1,"Yelp has my full review but here's the gist:

DO NOT COME HERE

The masseuses here are all terrible and non-verbal about solving your pain. The only good masseuse is Emilia, who my mom had as a masseuse and she was so professional, knowledgeable and really helped with the back pain.  I've had 5 massages here otherwise and all of them have been mediocre, with the exception of Dipti (perhaps the spelling is off) who is THE WORST. She must be related to the owner because otherwise I cannot see her being a trained massage therapist. So painful in places and then no pressure at all in the places that actually matter! And she will drown your body in oil so unnecessarily.

Reception is rude and unhelpful. They were 25 mins late for my massage that I had an appointment for. They lied and said there wasn't a double massage room which wasn't true, and then tried to make me and my mother go in at separate times without telling us that was the case. Iv'e called here multiple times and they must forget the name of their business 80% of the time because they answer with Hello?

Management is awful in so many ways. To their customers and to the employees.

Emilia is way too good for this place! Even though she's so great I will never be back to give these people my money.

I thought the owner must be more involved in running a better business because they respond to their reviews (besides yelp) but check out the below reviews for an example of management problems, every 5 star review gets a 1 hour free massage and people who shared a bad experience get 30 minutes.

Oakville,ChIJAytR501BK4gRX61wnLE5-II,Oneness Massage and Physiotherapy,M K,5,"10/10 recommend, and I've been coming for 5+ years! At first, I tried it out because of proximity, but now I'm so glad it's close by, because it's worth the drive over!

Reasons why I highly recommend:
- clinic is simple and clean
- plenty of free parking space in the plaza
- Oneness charges your insurance directly, so no need to pay for reimbursement
- washroom available if need be
- calls you the day before to confirm your appointment, so you never forget/miss it
- always super accommodating with your appointments (I knew I would be a few minutes late today, and when I let David know, he pushed my session by 15 minutes - thank you!)

I book Marina Pak as my RMT and she's always in tune to your needs and check in with you throughout the session to make sure you're comfortable and doing okay. She applies the perfect amount of pressure and I always come out feeling more refreshed and rejuvenated than before! When I expressed pain in my lower back, she gave me some printouts to stretching and building my core and glutes to support my lower back and they helped tremendously!

Oneness now offers fascial stretch therapy, which is like yoga, but the RMTs help you stretch while you keep your workout clothes on, and it's the greatest thing (also covered under insurance). Definitely give it a try to feel like you're walking on clouds afterwards!

I've tried other RMT clinics around Mississauga out of curiosity, but I always resort back to Oneness because of their fair pricing and how well they deliver on your paid time. Thank you, Oneness! Looking forward to my next session with you.",1742848697,6 months ago,2021S05075350516.08,5350516.08

The problem is the administration of the clinic. Why a resident in Long Term Care on 3N cannot access the services thru private pay is incomprehensible. Do you want business or not?  I guess you didn’t want mine. Totally discriminatory and this policy needs to change. If an inpatient in LTC can afford private pay, what the hell does the clinic care if the person lives outside the hospital or is just visiting.

Because of the archaic policies of this clinic, my mobility suffered greatly as the inpatient PT is woeful for seniors.

So thanks a lot for nothing, WF (specifically Huda). And you still owe me $55 for that appointment you cancelled on me that you made me pre-pay for.

I initially came in with multiple concerns: back pain, hip pain, and core muscle weakness. Thanks to Dr. Amr’s care and guidance, I am now completely pain-free and feel like I have a brand new body. The laser treatment was especially effective, and every session left me feeling stronger and more mobile.

The clinic itself is also a pleasure to visit: clean, well-decorated, and with a calm, welcoming ambiance that makes you feel at ease from the moment you walk in.

Oakville,ChIJg5y57ylDK4gRk1pyts-m928,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Oakville South,andre bennett,1,"Worst clinic ever!!!! Went there hoping to get injections in my hips, shoulder and help with my knee. Because I had multiple issues, I had to get separate referrals for each body part I needed help with. This costed me many trips back and fourth from my doctor getting referrals. After that got taken care of I finally got my first appointment. Unfortunately they also need to make separate appointments for each body part as well (not all at once) which also required constant trips back and fourth. This issue with that is the doctors there only work one day a week, the other maybe twice a week. Also I should add their latest appointment I like 3pm. This caused me to miss lots of time at work leaving for an appointment and then going back to work. Which didn’t go very well with my employer. This went on for over a month with multiple appointments with both doctors and absolutely no treatment. Constantly went to an appointment and then got told to make another appointment to be able to go any further with treatment. Finally by the last appointment, I was very excited that I may finally get the treatment that I’ve been waiting for since I started going there. Because it was essentially my first appointment for this specific body part. I was told “you guessed it” that I had to make yet another appointment if I wanted to be treated! Completely frustrated at this point. I just sat there pretty upset listening to what the doctor had to say, said ok, then asked if I could leave. To which she said “yes”. This is where it really gets interesting! I later get a text message saying all my further appointments have been cancelled due to abusive behaviour towards staff. Shocked and confused, I called the office to ask what was going on? Was told by front clerk that the doctor (Dr Manisha Sachdeva) wrote in her notes that “I was not receptive to the information she was giving” and that “I walked out half way during the appointment”.  Don’t know how that constitutes as abusive behaviour. But anyway I immediately I went on to explain that I literally started doing the exercises that she suggested right after leaving the clinic and that I literally asked her if I could leave, to which she said “yes” and THEN I left. Sure maybe I was upset which I had every right to be. But I never showed her any disrespect, never said anything inappropriate, literally did nothing wrong! In fact, I told the person on the phone if anything I’m the one being disrespected in this situation. She went on to say “well you’ve been referred to another clinic, so deal
with them now” with absolutely no remorse. I replied with “ that’s fine I wasn’t coming back anyways, but please don’t say that I was being abusive. I literally did nothing wrong” she said Ok and pretty much hung up the phone on me. I know this has been very lengthy but I really needed to create the context. Do not waist your time with this clinic! I literally booked an appointment with another clinic already and have an appointment the next day with the promise of treatment. 24 hours as apposed to 5-6weeks. Athletes care DOES NOT CARE!!! Especially Dr Manisha Sachdeva. If she cared even a little, she would adjust her schedule to maybe an 11-7 or 10-6 shift so she can at least accommodate for her patients that work a 9-5 type job. Especially since she only works one day a week... NOPE! They expect you to take the time out of your job to accommodate their hours. Even if it costs you multiple times back and fourth with no treatment. WORST CLINIC EVER!!!",1758066153,a week ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

I came to the clinic after a spiral fracture in my left humerus and honestly the whole experience has been incredible. Right from the start Matt explained everything so clearly; the anatomy, what had happened, and how we were going to fix it. What stood out most was how well he listens. He doesn’t just nod along, he really takes in what you’re saying and then applies his knowledge to get you moving in the right direction. That gave me so much confidence in the process, and now I’m fully recovered. I’ve got my arm back, 100%.

The clinic itself makes everything so easy. Direct billing takes the stress away, the app helps you keep track of your program and log progress, and booking appointments (with reminders) is simple. On top of that, the vibe is welcoming and professional. Every visit I was greeted by name, and the whole team makes it feel natural, not transactional.

What really impressed me is how flexible and consistent the care is. I worked mainly with Matt, but also had a couple of sessions with Leah Terry, and the transition was seamless. It showed me that no matter who you’re working with, you’re in great hands — the whole team is knowledgeable, supportive, and committed to keeping your recovery on track.

Recovery here really feels like teamwork. They don’t just hand you a program, they adapt it based on how you’re doing and keep you motivated at your pace. The more effort I put in, the faster I got results, and they were right there adjusting and encouraging me every step of the way. They’re great at meeting you where you’re at and helping you move toward full recovery in a way that feels achievable.

My husband and I came twice and one time we each had a great massage and another time, not so great. I have a concern about the “refer a friend” program. I made an appointment for my initial massage and sent a name for my friend who will come for a massage with me. I entered my name and my referred friend’s name in the system. Both my friend and I completed our massage and when it came time for us to pay, I was told the 10% off would be applied at our next visit. This doesn’t make sense to me as I came for a massage, and referred a friend as per the advertised program. Why was I not given the 10% discount once we completed our massage? So myself and my friend had to both make an appointment for a 2nd massage in order to receive our 10% discount. I am unhappy with the refer a friend program because it requires you and your friend to book 2 massages each in order to receive the advertised program special. If I referred a friend, which I did, then I should have been applicable for the program discount at the time of our completed massage. But I was not. I was told it was on my NEXT visit?! Myself and my friend have already given KEFI 4 massages and am not interested in coming back for more for the reason of the poor refer a friend program. I felt the program wasn’t fair and this was a negative for me.",1753478919,2 months ago,2021S05075350614.01,5350614.01

However, I was quite surprised and frankly outraged by the request for tip presented at the end. Massage therapy is a regulated medical service, not a hospitality experience, and it is absolutely unethical to request a tip for what is essentially medical treatment. Considering the already high cost of such appointments, especially for those seeking relief from ongoing body pain, I strongly advise against asking clients to tip and recommend removing this option from your machines.

By Norman

I am not really into giving references for services rendered but I felt that this was one time I should.

I found that Physio Link, Walkers Line, Burlington, provided a professional, positive support and very friendly caring environment.

It always provides great comfort and assurance when the initial contact with a business on being greeted by a pleasant receptionist, Manisha, who also forms part of the therapy team.

The therapists gave comfort to my therapy process by stating action to be taken and what each action during the process was intended to achieve for a successful resolution to one aspect of my injury within the scope of their care to be provided. I felt that having one therapist overseeing my care from one session to the next was reassuring for a focused game plan and follow through towards recovery. A special thanks to Helna for amazing support.

My therapy sessions started on time with my therapist providing a status update on noted physical changes and then providing modifications to the therapy in house and for me to do at home to help in my recovery. The therapist in each session provided specific instructions to support staff who utilized technology as part of the therapy each time.

I would like gratefully thank the staff of Physio Link for their personalized and dedicated effort for moving me forward on one part of my full recovery.

Dr. Iqbal is truly an exceptional chiropractor — knowledgeable, thorough, and so dedicated to patient care. He takes the time to explain everything, listens to concerns, and tailors treatment so you actually feel the difference right away.

Ana, the RMT, is equally incredible. Her massages are not only therapeutic but also deeply restorative — she has such a great understanding of how to release tension while keeping you comfortable throughout.

What really sets Reform Clinic apart, though, is that the entire team is fantastic. From the warm and welcoming reception staff to the other RMTs and doctors, every single person you encounter makes you feel cared for and valued.

The ladies at the front desk always greet you with a smile, ask how your day’s going, and make you feel welcome. It’s not just a clinic—it feels like a place where people genuinely care.

I came to R3 because of serious lower back pain and shooting pain down both legs. Working as a full-time mechanic down the street, I’m no stranger to daily aches, but this was something else. Harsh and Shirley have done an incredible job—my pain has gone from constant and sharp to almost nothing. These two really know what they’re doing.

What impressed me most is they didn’t just aim for short-term relief. They took the time to teach me proper exercises to strengthen muscles I didn’t even realize I had. It wasn’t just about fixing the issue—it was about making sure it doesn’t come back. That kind of approach is rare and appreciated.

Each session has been focused, professional, and filled with good conversation. No fluff, just real results. If you work hard, deal with physical strain, and want a team that truly understands how to get you back on track, R3 is the place to go.

Oakville,ChIJvxEUjdZDK4gRMIV8eojJRZk,WELL Health Medical Centres - Mississauga West,Nadeem Sadiq,1,"I had a very disappointing and frustrating experience at MCI Mississauga West Clinic today. I had an appointment scheduled for 2:30 PM, and I arrived on time and registered myself at the counter immediately, as I always do.

After registering, I waited in the seating area for over an hour, while multiple people who came after me were being called in. Eventually, I approached the front desk to ask about the delay, only to be told that I was not registered. I was shocked, as I’ve been using this clinic for over six months and never encountered this issue before. The staff member then told me she would now register me and call me next, which she did about 15 minutes later.

Once I was taken into a room, I waited another 15 minutes for the doctor. When she finally came in, I was told—very casually—that there was no staff available to assist and that the doctors had refused to see me or administer the injection. I was told to come back tomorrow.

This is completely unacceptable. Not only was I made to wait over an hour and a half, but I had also taken time off work and driven 30 minutes to get to the clinic. To be dismissed so carelessly after such a long wait, with no prior notice or concern for my time or health, is beyond disappointing.

This was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had at any clinic. I expect more professionalism, organization, and basic courtesy from a healthcare facility.",1754444961,a month ago,2021S05075350516.09,5350516.09

I took my wife for the therapy covered by OHIP under senior's plan. First session is normally expected longer with first 15 minutes for consultation and other 30 minutes physical therapy. On her first day visit a therapist came in with some medical equipment, wrapped some dirty rag type clothes around her knee, turned on the machine and left the room after saying will be back later. She did not ask a single question as to why she was there or where exactly was the pain. Practically no consultation. I presume she went by the limited information provided on their registration form. 30 minutes later she came back, unwrapped the rags, and said to come back on next appointment for second session. No instruction were provided for any exercise. How could she when she didn't even know what and where exactly was the problem.
Her next appointment was on June 13th. at 3.30pm. We arrived 10 minutes late and the person at reception refused to accept her for therapy. I even suggested to do the treatment for 15 minutes of her time slot. He refused again and said normally would have charged me $50,00 late fee. He would not listen to my requests and insisted that we should leave and return on next appointment. And we left for NEVER to go back again.",1719200687,a year ago,2021S05075350607.00,5350607.00

Christine is not just a phenomenal physiotherapist she is like family. Her knowledge, care, and dedication is unmatched. She always takes the time to explain things in a way that’s easy to understand and ensures I leave every session confident in my treatment and any at home exercises.
Darla at the front desk is an absolute gem. Every time I call and hear her voice, I know I’m going to get an appointment quickly and the whole process will be seamless. The entire team is incredibly warm, professional, and truly cares about their patients.
They offer every service you could possibly need, in your recovery and treatment thanks to the diverse knowledge of their team creating for an effortless experience when receiving multiple treatments. I’ve never had any issues with getting my treatment covered by insurance as everything is handled quickly and accurately. Their documentation for things like WSIB, schools, medical teams is always done properly and efficiently, and they’re great at coordinating conversations as needed.
I’ve recommended Christine and her team to my entire family (literally 5 of us ages 13-85 have attended for years) and to just about anyone who will listen. With many of them have going on to rave about the Lifemark Lakeshore clinic the same. When you find a clinic and team this good, you can’t help but spread the word.

Oakville,ChIJ66G4gvVcK4gRHbBJIlFSuN0,Lifemark Physiotherapy Lakeshore,James Montague,5,"About a year ago I had bell's palsy and I had to go for treatments and it was recommended by someone that i knew that we should try Lifemark. We met Christine and she was fantastic she helped me so much and then I met Nicole who at the time was helping as Christine's assistant.

After this I continued to come to get my neck treated, and then Nicole got her degree in physiotherapist and now I only see Nicole, first was my neck and now it's my ankle to my knee and if I was going to recommend any physio place in Oakville I would choose this one in Oakville. Best service and the kindness people that you will ever meet.

Then I was looking for someone for my back and to get massaged and this where I met Lisa who really changes my life and has really helped me. If you are someone that needs a good massage and direct billing is also a must contact Lifemark and book with Lisa, Lisa is not only does massages but she is also a wellness coach for those hard times that you are having in life.

When you call Lifemark you will be greeted by the worlds best receptionist and her name is Darla, Darla is the best and i have gotten to know Darla so much that with my community work I have invited her out to one or two of my events. Lindsay also works behind the desk but she does the 4-8pm shift, Lindsay is kind too but Darla is still ranked as #1!

Now that I see Nicole she also needs some support so I have gotten to know Morgan and there is another helper there but I can't think of her name at the moment but both are super and so great you just ring that bell and they come and assist you.

The only thing I wished they would get is better lights in there rooms. I'm not a fan of bright light and always feel bad when Nicole is trying to do the work too.

This please is like family to me and there is really no where else I rather go then Lifemark.

Christine has been so supportive in away that she is collecting Pop Tabs for Wheelchairs for my Girlfriend Sarah. If you drink from cans of pop, beer or anything with a pop tab start collecting them and bring them to your next appointment. We need 500 pop tabs to build a wheelchair help me and Sarah out and bring your tabs to Lifemark today!

Book your next appointment with Christine or Nicole and call Lifemark on Lakeshore and press 0 to contact Darla who will look after you! Don't forget to bring your pop tabs too!",1753210580,2 months ago,2021S05075350605.00,5350605.00

I’ve been seeing him twice a week, and within just a month, I noticed remarkable improvements.

We tried two settings and I found the second setting which h was less intense better for me. After, Sarah explained about the fees and payment structure. I booked appointments conditionally and could cancel providing I gave 48 hours ( 2 business days notice.) Cancellation fees would apply for the physio portion. I will likely proceed after discussing with my wife and insurance company. Very nice facility and experience.",1745442831,5 months ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

It felt like a very tailored experience. There is a large TV in the room playing classical music with soft water colours. I thought it might be a distraction, but once face down, it wasn’t.

I called this place who denied seeing any charges. When I gave them the out by saying did you bill it by mistake on my plan for someone else, they said yes wnd that they would ""reimburse"" it. Which means they could see the charge and they lied. I told them to reverse the claim since I hadn't been there for years, and then delete my insurance from mt file. They said they would but not holding my breath. Super sketchy to think because I'm not coming in anymore I must not be using the benefit so they make the claim anyways. How dare they take from someone's benefits for services not rendered..not only is it insurance fraud but their scam takes away from the patient's allowances on the plan for coverage they need. Shame.

Update: Clinic made every attempt to rectify the error including contacting my insurance and reaching out to me with an update. Still frustrated that they refuse to anonymize my file after repeated requests to remove all my personal information, saying they keep records for 7 years from date of last visit.

Oakville,ChIJnwxp9n5DK4gRf0Ugg4x6fO8,Care Plus Physiotherapy,Muhammad Owais,5,"Care Plus Physiotherapy – Excellent Care & Convenient Location

Care Plus Physiotherapy at 3465 Platinum Drive, Units 89 & 90, Mississauga is truly one of the best clinics for physiotherapy, orthotics, and sports injury treatments. The location is very convenient for patients coming from both Mississauga and Oakville—I personally come from Oakville, and the clinic is right next to the popular Ridgeway Food Plaza, making it easily accessible.

My entire family has been receiving care from Care Plus for several years for various muscle injuries and rehab needs. I first started treatment at another location after a motor vehicle accident, but after relocating to Oakville, I’ve continued all care at this Platinum Drive clinic due to the excellent service and convenience.

The staff is exceptional—professional, courteous, and always welcoming. When you walk in, you’re greeted with a warm smile from Khushpreet (“Khush” fittingly means “happy” 😊). She treats every patient with individual attention and kindness. The lead physiotherapist, Sukhpreet, is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced. She takes the time to understand each condition and customizes treatment plans accordingly. The resident physiotherapist Avnneet and Raman, are skilled physiotherapy residents who follow the lead physiotherapist’s plan closely and provide excellent care. The rotating staff members consistently deliver high-quality care to patients.

The clinic itself is modern and well-equipped, featuring a dedicated gym area with high-quality equipment used as part of rehabilitation and strength recovery. The treatment area is clean, spacious, and organized, with individual treatment beds offering privacy and comfort.

I truly highly recommend Care Plus Physiotherapy at this location to anyone in Mississauga, Oakville, or nearby areas. Whether it’s post-injury recovery, chronic pain, or ongoing physio needs, this team delivers top-tier care with compassion and professionalism.

A small suggestion for the owner, Ms.
Ravi Saran: While I know chiropractic care is available at other Care Plus locations, having a regular, permanent chiropractor at the Platinum Drive clinic would make this already-excellent facility even better and offer patients a more complete range of care in one place.",1752339898,2 months ago,2021S05075350516.38,5350516.38

MUV Therapy is truly outstanding, and Nadir deserves immense praise. After a back injury landed me in the ER, I was incredibly fortunate to find this clinic in Mississauga.
What sets MUV Therapy apart is their dedication to actually resolving the issue, not just offering temporary relief. You won't find time-consuming ice packs or machines here. Nadir swiftly pinpointed the root cause of my pain and began targeted, effective treatment immediately. I was back to feeling great in just two sessions! This speaks volumes about his expertise and the clinic's efficient approach.
Nadir is not only a highly skilled therapist but also deeply professional and empathetic. He genuinely cares about his patients' well-being, taking the time to understand your specific situation and craft a personalized plan that works. If you're in Mississauga and struggling with pain or an injury, I wholeheartedly recommend Nadir and the MUV Therapy team.

From the warm kind welcoming reception to the professionalism of the team. Nadir is extremely knowledgeable in the techniques he uses. He is patient and wants to see his clients get back to normal body movement without pain, and it shows. His methods are easy to learn and easy to do at home on your own!

I am 46 and have suffered from chronic back pain for almost 15 years. I was also was in a car accident a couple years ago, which affected my neck. I have seen different practitioners over the years and tried what I had thought was everything, until I was introduced to Nadir and his team! Within a few weeks of treatment I was noticing major improvement in my back, hip and neck pain. The work I have to do on my own for my recovery is extremely easy and doable. After noticing improvements I see how his techniques work and now if I don’t have the best posture or I start to feel some of my old pains coming back, I go right back into the stretches I was taught at Muv Therapy and I get the relief I need.

For the first time in years my body feels great and I never thought I would say this but my pain is mostly gone!

I can’t thank the Muv therapy team enough for helping me when I thought this was just going to be how life is with constant back and neck pain.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

If you are looking for relief and you think you’ve tried everything. Give Muv Therapy a try before giving up hope. I don’t regret it for a second!

They are always able to fit me in and work with my schedule.  They always wear a smile and are willing to help. They made me an appointment with Allison/Ally!

Let me tell you guys, she was heaven sent. She was able to accurately diagnose what my issue was and told me that I strained my ligament in my wrist which is common in athletes.

She worked with me to ensure I had the proper exercises to strengthen my wrist and get me back to being able to do what I love. My appointments were always on time. She always had a positive attitude. Super friendly, and we always have great conversations. After my wrist is completely healed up, I want her to take a look at my hamstrings.

I came in for a walk-in appointment and was initially told to wait 30 minutes. After that, I was added to a list and told the doctor would see me after her scheduled patients. They gave me a specific time to return, which I assumed meant my appointment would be honoured.

Unfortunately, when I returned, that wasn’t the case. I ended up waiting another 1.5 hours, and was repeatedly told I would be “next.” Meanwhile, I saw several patients who arrived after me being called in ahead.

My main issue is that I was given an appointment time — but it meant nothing. I wasted hours during my workday and still didn’t receive timely care.

My go to RMT is Ivana and if I’m not mistaken, she has background in traditional Chinese massage. The first time I went to Ivana I felt a level of relief I thought was going to be unattainable. I hold so much of my stress in my body that sometimes even the slightest massage can be painful. Ivana will seriously send relief through my entire body – her hands are made of magic! She gets so deep into my pressure points too which I really appreciate as that is something I usually have to ask for – I was pleasantly surprised when I realized Ivana listens to your body and will ensure to take action to correct whatever you are feeling.

My physiotherapist at this location is Peter. He is such an incredible person and physiotherapist. You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does; he truly cares to see his patients leave feeling better than when they came in. What I enjoy most about Peter is that he will always make sure you are comfortable being in his clinic, he will assess your entire body to see what other areas may be connected to your discomfort, he will massage the area, he adjusts as needed, he uses acupuncture relief (the best!), and he will even do chiropractic work as needed. In the middle of our sessions, I often can’t help but thank him because the relief always feels far better than I imagined before going into my appointment.

Thrive Physio is a prime example of how all of the little things make the bigger difference/impact on a person. I truly cannot express or show enough appreciation to everyone at this clinic.

Thank you for reopening my eyes to physiotherapy as well. For years I only stuck to chiropractic treatments as I felt I never “needed” physio – but the results and the relief my body feel would definitely beg to differ! :)",1682613865,2 years ago,2021S05075350520.01,5350520.01

My issue seemed so slight but impacted my every day movement and comfort. Stephanie was incredibly thorough. She wanted to make sure she could pinpoint exactly what was causing me pain and even had me intentionally aggravate my knee so she could see what I was dealing with outside of our sessions.

I felt at ease with her warm nature and attention to detail. Stephanie makes a plan that suits your needs and lifestyle. She takes the time to not only explain her method but also explain how each muscle, ligament and tendon connect to your area of concern. She not only wants to address your area of concern she wants her clients to understand it too!

Oakville,ChIJcXVagS5HK4gRwGaJ2NxGiMo,Cornerstone Physiotherapy - Port Credit,Thierry Arnaud,5,"At first, I was wary of having any number of sessions with Stephanie Kishimoto at Cornerstone Physiotherapy, as I have had physiotherapy previously with other therapists in other locations, with other companies.
None of those experiences were helpful.
She greatly impressed me, very fast!
Her approach permitted her to quickly identified problem areas of which I wasn’t even aware, and thereafter provide a comprehensive treatment plan that combines effective hands-on therapy with practical education.
She doesn’t just treat the symptoms—she takes the time to explain stretches and exercises I can easily apply to my day-to-day life, explaining not only how to do them, but why as she wants her patients to understand how they will help them to encourage them to follow through wherever they can, whenever they can.
By the end of my second week of sessions with her which took place twice weekly, I had regained more flexibility and mobility of my body than I had over the course of the past ten years combined with other physiotherapists, as they had merely placed hot pads on my back (or whatever those were), whereas Stephanie realized the source of the issue and treated it!
I have, of course, returned since, leaving each session feeling more informed, empowered, and hopeful about my progress. I cannot recommend highly enough Stephanie and the team at Cornerstone Physiotherapy to anyone looking for knowledgeable and caring physiotherapy support.",1757386509,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350540.01,5350540.01

Will change the rating to a 3 star because of the prompt follow up.

*Original review*
I have had great experiences with physio therapy services at many PhysioNow locations, I was recommended by the owner of the massage therapist here so came here when I had lower back pains as I wasn't able to get an appointment at my preferred locations within the week.
This was by far the worst massage I have ever gotten. I don't even know where to start, the pressure was all wrong she barely did any muscle massage as she preferred to just brush her hands across my body, there was no order to her operation, she was all over the place and not methodical about how she works around my back, a lot of the time she insisted on massaging through 3 layers of sheets/towels, the massage doesn't get deep into the muscle but more of a pinch/grab of the skin layer. It was extremely uncomfortable and did not help my issue at all. I would not recommend anyone coming here for their massage therapy.",1721660106,a year ago,2021S05075350505.02,5350505.02

Oakville,ChIJpVA22lFDK4gR8QjKCdmpBQg,Regenerative Health Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,Jacqueline Zonneville,2,"I’ve been dealing with debilitating, chronic pain since seeing Dr. Kings in May 2023, initially for help with tendon tears in my left glute. While he was quick to identify the tears in my left glute and hamstring and provide needed PRP treatment (which worked), I continued experiencing similar pain on the right side, which he dismissed and attributed to nerve issues rather than tendon damage. He did submit a requisite for a lumbar spine MRI and said he could be of no further help until after that. The whole time I knew the right side was also tendon related. So, after two+ years now of seeking treatment from various chiros, physios, etc. for both my spine disc issues and glute pain, I was finally diagnosed with tendon tears in the EXACT spot I flagged to Dr. Kings back in 2023. In the meantime, my right leg basically mummified in pain and restriction and my pain levels were consistently 10/10 (as a former athlete, I had to use a cane to walk last summer). Another sports medicine doctor has since started treatment with a series of PRPs, and I’m hopeful for recovery (since there are now a series of partial tears in my R glute/hamstring tendons and my body has gone through severe trauma so the mechanics are all impacted!). While Dr. Kings is clearly skilled, I didn’t feel like he truly cared about my well-being after addressing only part of my issues. I felt gaslit, unheard and left to navigate and advocate for myself. It’s been a long, frustrating and very painful journey, and though I considered returning to Dr. Kings for further care in 2024, I felt the treatment I needed was not fully addressed by him during our time together (or I wouldn't be in this whole mess).

Next, our visit was met with a clinician that was unforgiving of my child - redirecting him when he was doing the things he typically does - such as spinning on a chair or tapping his foot repeatedly. Instead of being understanding of this and seeing this as part of his profile, she kept asking him to stop. She seemed to be irritated by my child despite just meeting him. She also couldn't understand why we were there and shut us down regarding several avenues we wished to explore such as assessing him for primitive reflexes, supporting self-regulation, and looking for a way to help him thrive overall. Instead, she wanted to work on his reading. Fine. She conducted a reading test, which she interpreted the results incorrectly and said he was a great reader (which he is not!).

Right from the initial call to book the appointment I felt supported and was able to ask any questions I had.

I arrived at the clinic and was greeted in a friendly manner. Overall, the appointment was amazing (approx 2 hours long).

I first met with a research specialist who took my blood pressure, did some balance exercises and then had me fill out some additional questionnaires.

Then I saw the Doctor that specializes in concussions and he was really nice and knowledgeable. We talked through what happened, how I have been feeling, what I can expect moving forward and did some eye and neck movement assessments/exercises. I felt heard and acknowledged. Previously, I had seen quite a few doctors since my accident and they did not specialize in concussions, therefore I was not provided with very much information and/or resources to help with my recovery.

The last part of the appointment was with an Occupational Therapist (OT). She was also very knowledgeable and understood/validated the symptoms that I had been experiencing. She shared a lot of helpful information ie. things that I should start implementing into my daily routine to help with my recovery and gave me some resources to take home with me. Following the appointment, I received an email with additional resources  as well as her support/recommendation for a  gradual return to work plan to review with my short-term disability case manager and my employer.

I also have follow up appointments with a Physiotherapist and the OT which is great.

Although, I told her that she had no ill symptoms earlier and that I could bring her to the appointment as long as they are okay with it. The lady started yelling saying we don't want your sick daughter around us. ""You cannot bring her, DO NOT bring her"" with a very high pitched tone, and added that she will charge us anyways.

The pricing is excellent, and the facility itself is top-notch—clean, well-equipped, and welcoming. Wes and his team have truly transformed how I feel after years of workout-related wear and tear, and I couldn’t be more grateful.

What makes her stand out is not only her expertise, but also her genuine care and dedication to her patients’ well-being. Every visit is professional, thorough, and tailored to my needs, and I always leave feeling much better. She has truly made a huge difference in my health and quality of life. If you’re looking for a chiropractor who is highly skilled, compassionate, and committed to helping you heal, Dr. Nadia is the one to see!

What I also appreciate is that this practice offers more than just chiropractic care — their physiotherapy services have been just as valuable in helping with recovery and overall wellness. My family also comes here, and we have all had consistently positive experiences.

Beyond Dr. Nadia’s care, the entire practice is outstanding. The clinic has a warm and welcoming ambience, which makes every visit comfortable. The staff are always professional, friendly, and attentive, and I truly appreciate how punctual and well-organized the appointments are. It’s clear that the whole team values patient care and respect for time.

Angelito is amazing. He asks questions, listens, and remains focused on finding the root cause. Before proceeding, he’ll explains the problem, provide the solution(s), and gets to work to correct it. His comprehension of the bodies anatomy is far beyond ANYONE I’ve ever encountered in his field (Pssst - he’ll be giving you exercises to do to correct your ailment(s). As the saying goes, God can move mountains, but you better bring your shovel!) Angelito will also tell you he’s not out to schedule repeat sessions unless you don’t want to do the exercises. If you want to feel better, do what he says, then schedule yourself for tuneups if needed.

I enquired about shockwave therapy for my Plantar Fasciitis with Dr. Sam while waiting for my appointment as she was sitting at the reception desk. She told me it’s not a service they provide but said she would find me a source and email me. My first thought was, yeah right, I’m not even seeing you, why would you do that! Later that evening I received an email from her advising me of her find and gratuitously provide the information. That over the top experience, as well as my physical success with ACS, put this place light years ahead of other business with equal services.

I’ve worked with Catherine as well and she is an amazing massage therapist.

This team is always smiling and the facility is spacious and always very clean. They have Crocs at the entrance for you to change into upon entering. There’s even a Lysol can to disinfect those Crocs before you put them on and when you leave too! Another bonus.

The atmosphere is very Zen like and the Karma is extremely positive. What an amazing practice you must not miss if you’re looking for these services.",1738954714,7 months ago,2021S05075350236.02,5350236.02

Nina, another receptionist is always willing to write down my appointments on a sticky note and or text me my appointment for me when I book them.

Natalia is the osteopathic masseuse, who always greets you with a smile and is very knowledgeable at what she does. Even though her practice isn’t like a massage at a spa, she makes the experience very relaxing with music and asks you before starting where you’re experiencing pain.

The physiotherapy Doctor , is very knowledgeable and also asks where you are feeling pain to work in that spot, that session. Uses a shockwave machine on the spot that is causing you pain, uses bio freeze to help with the pain and gives you helpful exercise tips, to do at home.

I highly recommend this clinic as you will be treated as family and treated highly with care.

I’d like to thank Dun-dix for helping me through my road to recovery 🙏🏽

And would personally like to congratulate all the ladies, who work in the front for all their dedication and hard work you give daily.

Thank you!

Oakville,ChIJ-f8__7JcK4gRtfiVqPafvT8,The Discovery Center at Autism Behaviour Habilitation Services,Kerri Deganis,5,"Our son has been attending the Discovery Centre for two years now.  He is 12 years old, and previously attended another centre from the age of 4.  Our son was experiencing severe behaviour issues and starting to lose any ground he had gained from his ABA at the previous centre, largely due to a change in his programming at that other centre.  Mary and the team at Discovery Centre had him back on track within a few short months, and since then he has excelled with both behaviour management and learning life skills that he will need down the road.  The entire team at the centre are so kind, patient, focused and professional.  They are 100% focused on their families, not on billable hours as I've found so many other centres to be, and will not stop strategizing and incorporating different programs into a child's therapy until they achieve results.  They never give up on their kids!  Highly, highly recommend.",1641916940,3 years ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

This was really frustrating because we knew the importance of early intervention.  Honestly at first I was undecided if ABA was right for us however he always was really excited to go and something that he seemed to look forward to. Everyone is super friendly and really seems to care about him.  They're really great with communicating and there were a few occasions they would give me daily updates while he was in session which I really appreciated.  I was lucky enough to go into the centre and observe a session while restrictions were eased, which was never available at the last place.  We enjoy coming here - ABA isn't a ""quick fix"" but we've seen him develop new skills and independence over time which makes us quite hopeful of the future. ❤",1641696416,3 years ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

Right from the start the center was very warm and open to any questions I had as we had just moved into the area. Moving forward there was monthly follow ups on how my son was progressing. Any time I needed a shoulder to cry on - on those not so easy days- his teachers had always been a friend and would listen and help with strategies how we could fix any concerns I had. When it was his time to move forward and not continue with the center it was very bitter sweet .

I’ve been seeing Disha for over a year now, and honestly, she has been a lifesaver. I never really believed in physiotherapy until I met her.

I was struggling with severe issues in my hands (especially my thumbs). I couldn’t sleep, work, or function properly. After about six months of consistent therapy, I’m now 99% healed—it’s mostly just maintenance at this point. I started with twice-weekly sessions, then moved down to once a week, and now I only need to see her about every two weeks for my hands. I can’t put into words how grateful I am for the difference she has made.

More recently, I developed a Baker’s cyst behind my knee that left me in extreme pain. Both my family physician and a rheumatologist recommended physiotherapy, so of course I went straight to Disha. After just two visits, my pain has already reduced by more than half—I could hardly
believe it!

I love sports (🎾🏓🏸⛷️⛸️🛼🚴🏐🤿🪸) and suffer from numerous injuries. I started going with a ""tennis tear"" in my elbow, which I strained while playing tennis. That's how I met Emma. Despite my poor English, her patient listening and constant smile provide the first step to recovery, ""peace of mind.""

Just when I thought my tennis tear had completely resolved with Emma's spot massages and exercises, I got a knee injury I fell on while playing volleyball. My recovery is ongoing. While receiving treatment at Wintergreen, I feel comfortable and at peace, as if I were in my own home. I don't feel out of place. The quiet, peaceful, and bright atmosphere are wonderful. Thanks a lot. 🌸

Let's not forget the friendly faces of the staff who greeted us at the entrance.

Alexa;
While continuing with Emma, ​​I had the opportunity to meet Alexa and receive a cryotherapy session from her. Alexa truly does her job beautifully; she takes her time, calms me down, and does what she needs to do. She released years of accumulated stress from my bones, relieving it. She takes her time wisely, and if I have a skeletal issue, she addresses it first, starting with those areas and applying the necessary techniques. Thanks a lot. 🌸

Wintergreen is a highly elite institution where everyone, from near or far, should benefit from its healthcare services.

When I go somewhere, I don't share my opinion based on my first impression. I went for the second time today and was truly pleased.

It was a one-hour session, and I felt like the time flew by. Raquel first briefly discussed my pain and then immediately focused on the aches and pains I was experiencing. Her hands seemed to find the aching areas themselves. Her hands are truly healing. The atmosphere at Wintergreen Physiotherapy & Sports Medicine is clean, free of unpleasant odors and distracting sounds, and the room's dim lighting and gentle jazz music make it peaceful and far from the noise of the world.

I thank her so much and can't wait for my next appointment.

Nowadays, consumers read 1-star reviews first. I was going to give 1 star so everyone could read my experiences, but since no one had given Wintergreen a single star, I didn't. Of course, that was just a joke :)). Since 5 stars is the maximum you can give, I gave 5. If it were possible, I would have given 100 out of 100.

Most appointmentswith Kathryn and Robert lasted less than an hour, no one did any physiotherapy with me. Just used machines that aren't clinically proven to work, and made me ride a bike and bounce on a trampoline and lift weights. Where is the therapy in that??

I tried asking them about my joint pain from my hyper mobility as well. Asking if certain braces would help, and asking for exercises. But Kathryn seemed to pretend like she didn't understand. And when she ""did understand"" she said she couldn't do anything to help. ""There's nothing to do"". But now I've been referred to an EDS hyper mobility clinic by my doctor. It felt like she just didn't want to do her job.

They were also very unprofessional and had quite lazy behavior. They did maybe one or two good treatment sessions and then just decided to stop trying. And my treatment wasn't working.  I eventually just stopped showing up and they didn't even call to see why. They don't care about treatment. Just money. Robert was even complaining to me about my insurance not covering certain HST. That's your problem bud, not mine.

On top of that, it's only the two of them working there. Husband and wife, and sometimes their son. It's pretty strange, and the dynamic is weird. Like you can tell when they've had an argument that morning. I don't like this place at all, and I feel like there's something else going on there.

To start - I scheduled my appointment online, and they called me on the day-of to re-book me for a different time slot that day. I didn't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with waiting an hour to see someone once I arrived at the clinic...

Once the physiotherapist entered the room, she rushed my diagnosis in the matter of 30 seconds or so, then attached these electrodes to my arm (A therapy which is proven to not have any scientific benefit by the way). Then when I asked to just focus on the root cause of the issue and what I can do to help it, she said they didn't have time to do a proper assessment and that I would have to come back at another time next week... Why should I have to pay for another appointment because they couldn't properly schedule me in the first time?? Also why do they not focus on the root cause of the issue in the first appointment?

The clinic is also not very well designed. Patient rooms are separated by curtains taken straight out of a hospital ER, so you can hear multiple people next to you and you have virtually zero privacy. I get the feeling this place is run like an assembly line, which the goal is to get people in and out as quickly as possible without actually helping them, and not addressing the root cause of their symptoms so they keep coming back...

After having this terrible experience they thankfully did offer me a full refund, which I took. I have recently seen a much better physiotherapist who was able to properly assess my condition, help me recover to the point where I am able to start playing baseball again!

Please, save your time and money and go to a different place.",1689646687,2 years ago,2021S05075350513.03,5350513.03

Whether it's been a sports injury, recovery from surgery, or general mobility concerns, Daniella has consistently provided tailored treatment plans that deliver real results.

What really sets this clinic apart is the full team.  Every therapist and assistant I've interacted with has been welcoming, kind, attentive, and highly skilled. There's a genuine sense of collaboration and support in everything they do.  You never feel rushed and always feel like you’re in capable hands.

One of the most helpful aspects is that they always provide clear, practical exercises to do at home, which really accelerate the recovery process and empower you to take an active role in your own healing. You're not just treated during your appointment - you’re given clear, practical exercises to continue your recovery between sessions. These exercises are thoroughly demonstrated and explained, and they’re even emailed to you with video links to ensure you’re doing them correctly at home. This support has been a huge part of my progress, and it’s empowering to be actively involved in your own healing process.

Last year, I was working with Brian (physio), Trevor (chiro), and Sarah (chiropodist) for hip, knee, and foot issues. After receiving treatment for a few weeks and giving orthotics a try, I opted for further imaging which was diagnostic of a heel spur, plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinitis and arthritis in the knee.

I returned to Athlete’s Care earlier this year and in Brian’s absence, I started working with Lucky (physio). She has TRULY made a difference in my bodily mechanics. She is very skilled and knowledgeable, I would happily recommend her to anyone in search of a great physiotherapist.

By the time I stood up, I felt like I had just survived a wrestling match with a grizzly bear. I dragged myself to the ER, thinking, “Surely they’ll help me, I look like a man auditioning for The Walking Dead.”

Nope. I spent 5 hours crying in the waiting room like a toddler who dropped his ice cream. Sitting was impossible, so I just stood there the whole time like a sad decorative lamp. Eventually even my legs gave up, and guess what? The ER gave me absolutely nothing. Not a pill, not a pat on the back, not even a participation ribbon.

Enter Jay Bhuta at LeDrew Professional Sports Medicine. I walked (well… shuffled) into his clinic, and I swear, after ONE session I felt like Lazarus being resurrected. Suddenly I could move again. The pain didn’t magically vanish, but I went from “crying statue” to “functioning human being” in an hour. That’s basically sorcery.

When I tried to share relevant background and past MRI results, it felt like my input was dismissed and the decision had already been made.

In light of recent serious incidents—including a patient death following a nerve block procedure under his care, and numerous negative public reviews—I am troubled that there appears to be no visible accountability or corrective action regarding his practice. These experiences do not align with patient-centered care, shared decision-making, or informed consent—all basic standards that patients should be able to expect.

If others have encountered similar substandard encounters, I strongly urge them to document and report their experiences to the relevant regulatory authorities. Timely investigation and accountability can help ensure patient safety and maintain trust in our healthcare system.",1758854949,in the last week,2021S05075350610.03,5350610.03

My inflammation was so bad, my low back and legs were so painful I could not walk, still to this day I'm having issues with my low back and legs and my MRIs show I have multiple issues with my low back, but because my pain from inflammation was wide spread he did not take me seriously.  He asked me from one to 10 how bad is my pain ? I said 10 because to me it was a 10, he asked me if I had a hot poker in my eye would I still be standing there ? He kept saying only your back pain, well that day I had pain all over including my low back , he wanted me to give him a number one to 10 so I said 7, after injections he asked again , and I replied I feel numb but he wanted a number so I said 4 . He escorted me out and when his assistant called me if I was tracking my pain I said  no because I was not even aware I was suppose to , I just said I still felt pain and I was told over the phone by a male assistant that Dr Fennell would not be seeing me anymore.  Terrible experience I still remember that day clearly

*Edit
Just wanted to update. I am truly grateful for the amazing care and pain management I have from my treatments. I also want to address comments about his bedside manner. He is not a doctor to hand out narcotics. He will not write you prescriptions for Percocetts.
He is about alternatives. I went in and I knew he was ""screening"" me to see if I was there to get better and help myself or just give me drugs. Yes, he can be abrupt but only if he knows you aren't willing to do the work, try alternatives and he knows if you have done the work at home. Once Dr. F knew I was serious and saw me trying, his demeanor changed. Unfortunately doctor's who deal in pain management are visited by so many people who just want a pill to ""fix"" them.

Oakville,ChIJWx0vZ_1DK4gRHEDWcTzQJYk,Medcan,Javairia A,2,"I’ve been a patient here for some time, but unfortunately, the quality of service has declined. I had a 1:15 PM appointment and arrived at 1:24. While I understand I was late, I was disappointed to be turned away without any notice, especially after making the trip. A courtesy call would have saved me the inconvenience.

What’s more frustrating is that there’s no direct way to contact the reception at the location. You have to go through a centralized call center, which makes it difficult to communicate something as simple as running a few minutes behind. As a paying patient, I expected a bit more flexibility and communication. I hope they consider improving responsiveness and patient care moving forward.

Update

To add to the frustration, the virtual appointment that was rescheduled instead saw the doctor arrive over 10 minutes late. I had to follow up with customer service ( again not a direct number to the clinic) just to confirm whether the doctor would show up. It’s disappointing that patients are expected to wait without question, while there is little flexibility or understanding shown when the situation is reversed.

I hope you will take this feedback seriously and work on improving responsiveness, consistency, and mutual respect in patient-provider interactions going forward. Patients are held to a strict policy, yet there seems to be more flexibility and leniency when the delay is on your end. Just offering to reschedule isn’t a real solution when the system itself doesn’t support fair and responsive care.

The doctor I’ve been working with absolutely gets five stars, she’s phenomenal. And the rest of the team during my annual assessment was amazing, and thorough. Where they’ve lost me is at their referrals team level. I’ve had to chase them 3 times to send the right documentation over to the clinic that I’ve been referred to because of some concerning results on a breast scan. Firstly they needed a reminder to send my referral as the clinic had no documentation for me to even book an appointment. Following that, they failed to attach the appropriate paperwork so my referral was rejected. I’ve had to call them 3 times to get this referral done properly and it’s still not fixed. In the midst of a potentially very scary diagnosis the last thing people should have to do is chase this team to have it done correctly. What exactly are we paying for if we’re still navigating the same frustrations faced in our health care system? It’s really unfortunate, because it’s otherwise been a wonderful experience. But not worth it if this is the end result.

Updated to add that I have now had to follow up 5 times and my referral has still yet to be sent to the cancer clinic. This has been a beyond horrible process working with the offshore referrals team at Medcan. These are peoples lives that are being mismanaged.

The guy (very young to practice by himself) who had to take my blood checked my appointment on his phone but didn't washed his hands before procedeeing to put the needle in my arm and get my blood. I didn't say anything then, to not be a difficult person, even though this is not a correct hygenic procedure in a medical setting involving blood tests and needles. Then he proceeded to put the needle in my arm and take my blood. He didn't pay attention to what he was doing so that I saw my blood was going all over the place: my arm, outside the tube, etc, splashing around. He then realised that he needs to stop and to wipe all my blood from there rest of the tubes (my blood was splashing around because he didn't set the tube correctly). I said ""no problem, we learn from mistakes"", I tried to be nice. I asked him to wash his hands before he puts another needle in my arm to continue collecting my blood. He didn't want to but in the end he did it. He then put the needle in the same arm but in such a horrible wrong way, that he must have put in exactly in my nerve. I have never in my life felt so much pain from having a needle put into my skin. I don't wish that to anyone. My tears started comming out in a second and my body started trembling.

My husband and I had been feeling extremely sick for 15 days after traveling abroad, trying various over-the-counter medications without relief. When we visited Dr. Seif, she completely disregarded our symptoms. Instead of focusing on our health concerns, she started sharing personal stories about how much she dislikes snow and wants to travel.

Despite our repeated attempts to explain our condition, she simply dismissed us, stating that “everyone in Ontario has it” and offering no real diagnosis. She gave us inhalers, suggesting we had asthma, but provided no further explanation or treatment. As our condition worsened, we sought help from another clinic, where the doctor diagnosed us with severe bronchitis from travelling we mentioned we travelled she said so what.  The other clinic prescribed antibiotics, sprays, and additional inhalers which provided a lot of relief and dr Mona said our chest was clear whereas the other clinic doctor said we were very severely suffering. We were both shocked by how Dr. Seif failed to properly assess our health and left us feeling dismissed and unheard and we could  have recovered and went back to work but she wasted one week of our recover time.

If you want to go to a day spa where you can relax for an hour or so in the relaxation room before a service. This is not the place.  I’m not sure if ownership has changed but there is a marked change in the service and atmosphere here.  I used to go often for years and I am sad to say I will not be returning.   This is what I would suggest to the owners:
1.  Train your staff not to ask customers to please start their massage 15 minutes earlier than their appointment because ‘ they need to get home early’.   It’s not professional to ask a client who is trying to relax and read a book and unwind before a massage.  But to ask a second time is actually rude.  Don’t rush your customers.  Life is busy, give them some time to relax if they have made time in their schedule to arrive early to do so.
2.  If taken into a room that has not been cleaned and has used towels and sheets in the room, train your RMT’s to apologies and guide them back to the lounge while the room gets cleaned.  To ask a client to wait in the treatment room while it gets cleaned is again, completely unprofessional.
3.  Change your lighting back to the low light it used to be years ago so people feel like they are in a spa and not in a convenience store.
4.  People used to LOVE coming here for the cinnamon tea, when you water it down in the urn to try save a few bucks, customers notice,  and again, it detracts from the over-all experience.",1753737881,2 months ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

Recently, I called while driving to book a massage that was starting within about 40 minutes. The receptionist kindly told me there was a spot, but I was surprised when she asked for my credit card to secure the booking, as this had never been required in the past.

I completely understand the business perspective, no-shows cost the spa time and money, and I have no problem with the policy itself. My concern was that I explained I was driving and didn’t have my card handy, and since the appointment was less than an hour away, I asked if an exception could be made. The receptionist checked with the manager, but I was told the policy could not be waived.

This left me very disappointed. A healing spa should value understanding and customer care as much as financial policies. When money is placed before the human aspect of service, it no longer feels like a place of healing. Sadly, I cannot continue to be a customer of a system where revenue is prioritized over respect and compassion.",1757164822,3 weeks ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

However, looking at other reviews as well, there definitely seems to be a trend with the receptionists (not really a receptionist but another RMT whose name I know from your website) and their lack of friendliness.

Like another reviewer said, I had hardly entered and was immediately asked what my name was. No greeting, no welcome, no smile. This continued even after the massage ended & I came back to the reception for payment. It was like she had a problem that I was there. Didn’t even respond when I greeted on my way out. Just a don’t care attitude to be honest.  Hated the way she made me feel.

I went to her in January/February 2025. As I came in, she took the time to listen to everything I had to explain and understood the energy/spiritual aspect of the healing I needed, not just having “pain” compare to others acupuncturists.
I had an issue with my tongue since 2023 after alcohol intoxication, doctor told me I was allergic and to stop drinking ever again,
she proposed to me an herbal remedy which I took not completely yet and while doing it my tongue already went almost all back to normal 85% I would say with the little I took so far, (I need to continue and finish all the tea. She can give you the remedy but we have to follow through with it as she will explain how to do it). But it is a worry less in my mind.

She really is an amazing doctor in my eyes. My point is to not be ashamed or to not leave any details when you go see her, be open and explain because I am pretty sure she will have a cure.

I was suppose to continue my acupuncture treatment which I only did 2 so far, because I lost my job and need to get that sorted first, but as soon as I can I will be back to her and cannot wait to continue healing along with her.
I write this review now because it has been on my mind and I want everyone who is seeking a real healing place in GTA to go see her, you won’t be disappointed. I am very glad I found her and she will be my go to anytime.

She reduced my anxiety tremendously and helped me let go of stuck emotions especially in my spleen area.
I hope anyone who is desperate or can’t seem to find the right person to heal them see this and try to go see her.

All the best Judy, hopefully I will see you soon again!

I would heavily suggest to stay away from this place, the owner and Lisa are both crazy extremely unreasonable & unprofessional individuals. I bought their skincare products that were extremely expensive for no reason and saw ZERO results.

I initially was gonna go ahead with a micro needling + laser package with them but due to some unexpected family consequences the package became too expensive for me and within less than 24 hours I notified Lisa, I can no longer continue with the laser + micro needling package.

No treatment started - nothing was initially done & she said the package is ‘non refundable’ which was never mentioned when we initially started discussing the package. Mind you, I have done ZERO treatments and she is trying to force me to take the treatment and without my consent trying to charge me??

I’ve never dealt with such inconsiderate ‘professionals’ in my life who have no regard for another individual & what’s going on in their life. They could have still retained me as a customer if they tried to work something out but due to their greed & selfishness not only did they lose me as a customer but I will be proceeding with legal action since they are charging me without my consent.

No terms & agreement were mentioned & now everytime she calls me she mentions a new “policy” that was added hence why she can’t cancel my package.

Absolutely unbelievable, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD STAY AWAY!",1758848175,in the last week,2021S05075350604.00,5350604.00

For the last few months, I have seen three specialists concerning different issues with my body (which have all been treated extremely well by each practitioner): Shelby Stableford for acupuncture, Domenic Manchisi for massages, and Andrew Marrone for physiotherapy concerning my right knee.

Shelby is extremely professional and skilled when it comes to acupuncture, where every appointment I had with her, I left feeling better than when I entered. Domenic is very charismatic and very skilled at his work, he creates a soothing/calming atmosphere when performing his massages, making me feel like a million-bucks every time I had left my appointment with him.

Andrew is a physiotherapist whom I booked with, and saw the most there. He always provided me with the best exercises, treatment, and professional advice to help me recover. If it weren't for him, my knee wouldn't have gotten stronger, and allowed me to be ready for a smooth ACL surgery process thanks to his help in preparing me for it.

I highly recommend Shelby, Domenic, and Andrew when booking for either acupuncture, massages, or physiotherapy, they are very well-spoken, professional, caring, and absolutely skilled at their practices.

Judice listen to me talk about my skincare journey and took plenty of notes on past irritation, treatments that I have done and future goals I have for my skin. She then went through my current routine, product by product and read through its ingredients.

After her intake, she explained what I was experiencing, her detailed plan to combat any further irritation, mitigate what I am currently experiencing and plans to reach future goals.

With every session, I brought on more questions to her and I was met with an immense amount of knowledge and understanding. After a few sessions, I started seeing results and I felt more confident in the direction my skin was going in. As my skin progressed, she explained in details our next steps and why she was choosing certain products over others. She also started teaching me how to watch out for triggers, learn how to read products and separate the good products from the bad.

The latter became worse overtime that it would even radiate to my neck specially when I wake up in the morning. I enjoy my job a lot  but this type of pain holds me back from such activity until I receive chiropractic care by Dr. Brian and Physiotherapist Dr. Deepali

They were able to address them and I can already feel the improvement. I can now move freely without complaining about my shoulders being stiff after.

More so, these were not included in my issues as I came to Dr. Brian for chiropractic care but I have observed that my precious injury on my left knee is getting a lot better.

Healing is a process and it’s a two way effort. By religiously following the home exercises Dr. Deepali gave me plus following the scheduled adjustments to keep me on track with my care plan, I believe we will be able to attain my health goals.

He's so good with her and well rounded when it comes to babies. Lots of experiance and knows the industry well also.

I had a very severe case of sciatica after falling down the stairs, and no medication or physiotherapy was helping me recover until I saw Dr. Lisa and she suggested to try acupuncture since nothing else worked. One year later, I'm 98% recovered from any pain in my back and feel more free.

Oakville,ChIJBbTGYrlBK4gR9RIareDHP5A,INNOVA INTEGRATED WELLNESS CENTRE,Shawn Bhatia,5,"It gives me great pleasure to write this review about Dr. Lisa Ramsackal (my Chriopractor) and Asmita (my Physiotherapist).

Initially, I contacted this clinic via telephone in March 2025 with a concern regarding pain in my feet. Dr. Ramsackal was extremely pleasent to speak with. She addressed my concerns by telephone at the level of someone who possess outstanding customer service skills. She must have spent 15 minutes discussing my concerns. I could ""feel"" the sincerity within her to treat my feet pain at her clinic.

I booked an appointment with the clinic the following week. Dr. Ramsackal was forthright from the beginning about the treatment process and the necessary medical equipment needed for a full recovery (i.e. orthotics, and compression socks).

While presently undergoing chiropractic care, I concurrently am seeking physiotherapy care with Asmita. I can testify that Asmita is an amazing physiotherapist with outstanding skills to treat my pain. After only 2 weeks of theraputic exercieses prescribed by Asmita, I observed a significant reduction in the intensity of feet pain. To this present day, I visit Asmita bi-weekly for ongoing maintenance and preventative care (to mitigate the risk of symptom recurrence).

I harbor a steadfast stance with my testimony about Innova Integrated Wellness Centre. I foster a strong supposition that anyone who attends this clinic for any pain will be looked after well. Awesome job!!",1753715508,2 months ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

From my very first session, I felt not only welcomed but genuinely cared for. Over time, the consistent relief and balance these treatments have provided—whether for stress, pain management, or overall well-being—have made acupuncture an essential part of my wellness routine.
The practitioner’s skill, intuition, and dedication are truly exceptional. They take the time to understand where I’m at physically and emotionally, adapting the treatment with care and precision every single time. I’ve come to trust this process deeply, and I always leave each session feeling renewed, restored, and more in tune with myself.
If you're considering acupuncture, I wholeheartedly recommend this practice. It's more than a treatment—it's a transformative experience.",1754077473,a month ago,2021S05075350550.02,5350550.02

Dr. Tom Vleugels is an exceptionally experienced bariatric and abdominal surgeon

From our first consultation, Dr. Vleugels and his multidisciplinary team were supportive, honest and attentive. They listened carefully to our goals, explained the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery, and helped us prepare for the lifestyle changes that would follow. On the day of surgery the care we received was compassionate and professional, and during the recovery period the follow‑up from the clinic was outstanding. The nursing staff were always available with encouragement and advice; I never felt like just another patient.

The results have been life‑changing. Both my mother and I have lost a significant amount of weight, we feel healthier than ever, and many of our obesity‑related health issues have improved or resolved. We’re able to be more active and enjoy life again. We had considered travelling to Thailand or Turkey for bariatric surgery, but discovering Wellness Kliniek in Genk, Belgium, was fantastic. The clinic’s accreditation and Dr. Vleugels’s reputation for excellence made us feel safe and well looked after

Burlington,ChIJFe2LfktgK4gRIrw9pyeDweo,Burlington Sports and Spine Clinic,Mitchell Silva,5,"Working with Matt Hickey and the entire team at Burlington Sports and Spine was the difference between pain and 100% recovery.

I came to the clinic after a spiral fracture in my left humerus and honestly the whole experience has been incredible. Right from the start Matt explained everything so clearly; the anatomy, what had happened, and how we were going to fix it. What stood out most was how well he listens. He doesn’t just nod along, he really takes in what you’re saying and then applies his knowledge to get you moving in the right direction. That gave me so much confidence in the process, and now I’m fully recovered. I’ve got my arm back, 100%.

The clinic itself makes everything so easy. Direct billing takes the stress away, the app helps you keep track of your program and log progress, and booking appointments (with reminders) is simple. On top of that, the vibe is welcoming and professional. Every visit I was greeted by name, and the whole team makes it feel natural, not transactional.

What really impressed me is how flexible and consistent the care is. I worked mainly with Matt, but also had a couple of sessions with Leah Terry, and the transition was seamless. It showed me that no matter who you’re working with, you’re in great hands — the whole team is knowledgeable, supportive, and committed to keeping your recovery on track.

Recovery here really feels like teamwork. They don’t just hand you a program, they adapt it based on how you’re doing and keep you motivated at your pace. The more effort I put in, the faster I got results, and they were right there adjusting and encouraging me every step of the way. They’re great at meeting you where you’re at and helping you move toward full recovery in a way that feels achievable.

By Norman

I am not really into giving references for services rendered but I felt that this was one time I should.

I found that Physio Link, Walkers Line, Burlington, provided a professional, positive support and very friendly caring environment.

It always provides great comfort and assurance when the initial contact with a business on being greeted by a pleasant receptionist, Manisha, who also forms part of the therapy team.

The therapists gave comfort to my therapy process by stating action to be taken and what each action during the process was intended to achieve for a successful resolution to one aspect of my injury within the scope of their care to be provided. I felt that having one therapist overseeing my care from one session to the next was reassuring for a focused game plan and follow through towards recovery. A special thanks to Helna for amazing support.

My therapy sessions started on time with my therapist providing a status update on noted physical changes and then providing modifications to the therapy in house and for me to do at home to help in my recovery. The therapist in each session provided specific instructions to support staff who utilized technology as part of the therapy each time.

I would like gratefully thank the staff of Physio Link for their personalized and dedicated effort for moving me forward on one part of my full recovery.

A Truly Restorative Experience with Suzy at Trend Physio

From the moment I walked in, Suzy made me feel completely at ease. She thoughtfully adjusted the surroundings to ensure I was comfortable—table, covers, lighting, temperature, even the music—all without a hint of judgment. That level of care and attention instantly set the tone for what turned out to be one of the most relaxing massage sessions I’ve ever had.

Suzy’s technique was exceptional. Every movement felt intentional and expertly delivered, melting away tension I didn’t even realize I was holding onto. Her intuitive approach made it easy to fully let go—and I’m pretty sure I drifted off and snored at one point (a testament to how deeply relaxed I was!).

If you’re looking for a massage that goes beyond the physical and truly nurtures your well-being, Suzy is the one. I left feeling lighter, looser, and completely recharged. Can’t wait to book my next session!

So far, our experience at Joseph Brant Hospital has been pretty solid. Everything looks clean and well-kept, and there’s definitely a professional tone throughout the place. Staff have been very friendly and helpful from check in to prep smooth process overall.

My friend is currently going through ankle surgery, and we’re mid way through the whole experience. So far, things feel well-organized and reassuring. As with most hospitals, surgeons can vary in bedside manner, really depends on the day and the doctor, but that’s kind of expected.

One thing that definitely stands out is the parking situation. It’s $19 for the day, which might be standard for a hospital, but still feels steep especially when you’re already stressed about surgery. It’d be nice if patients undergoing procedures or their families were offered some kind of validated or discounted rate. Just a small gesture that would go a long way.

Convince of pharmacy and Tim’s Hortons ☺️

Overall, it’s been a positive experience. Hoping the rest of the journey continues just as smoothly.

No medication had been able to help, so I decided to try something new. From the very first session, Sophie was compassionate, thorough, and incredibly professional.

For those unfamiliar with Traditional Chinese Medicine, it takes a holistic approach, focusing on understanding the body as a whole rather than treating symptoms in isolation. During the intake, Sophie asked detailed questions about my health, lifestyle, and daily routine. She was able to connect the dots and identify underlying issues contributing to my vertigo, rather than just focusing on the vertigo itself.

The acupuncture session was a great experience. Sophie took her time, explaining every step of the process and ensuring I felt at ease. While acupuncture involves needles (so it’s not the most comfortable treatment), her calm and clear communication helped me feel safe and open to the process.

Two days after my first session, I felt significant relief from my vertigo. I’m so grateful for Sophie’s expertise and her holistic approach to care. If you’re considering acupuncture, I highly recommend her!",1737307560,8 months ago,2021S05075370222.01,5370222.01

He was told by his massage therapist to see the chiropractor, but when we called, the receptionist kept pushing him to book physio instead and even offered a discount. It felt kinda pushy even though we were ok with the chiro's next availability but we just went with it.

The first appointment was with Kanu. The assessment was super quick, like under 10 mins. The only treatment he got was a TENS machine, which honestly he could’ve just done at home.

Next time he saw a different female physio who came off a bit rude and didn’t seem to clean any of the equipment after use, which was pretty off-putting.

Overall the place didn’t feel clean and the treatment was something I could've done myself. My dad won’t be going back and we wouldn’t recommend it to others.",1756506657,4 weeks ago,,

First of all, the place is in disrepair and looks extremely unprofessional -both inside and out. This is not how a business should be portrayed. Dirty, stuff everywhere, disorganized, and messy.
Next, our visit was met with a clinician that was unforgiving of my child - redirecting him when he was doing the things he typically does - such as spinning on a chair or tapping his foot repeatedly. Instead of being understanding of this and seeing this as part of his profile, she kept asking him to stop. She seemed to be irritated by my child despite just meeting him. She also couldn't understand why we were there and shut us down regarding several avenues we wished to explore such as assessing him for primitive reflexes, supporting self-regulation, and looking for a way to help him thrive overall. Instead, she wanted to work on his reading. Fine. She conducted a reading test, which she interpreted the results incorrectly and said he was a great reader (which he is not!). This was an absolute disappointment and I actually left angry and couldn't wait to get out of there. Never again will I come to this unkempt and unprofessional office to waste my money.

Treatment included deep trigger point release with dry needling, cupping to ease the tightness, and exercises that were specific to building the strength and mobility I needed on the court. The progress was steady, and before long the pain and stiffness had eased up and I felt confident moving again.

Burlington,ChIJD8TZ2clhK4gRs7HkBtJS1K0,Kareem Hassanein - Registered Physiotherapist,Fel Rocci,5,"I had ACL surgery on my right knee following a tennis injury in April, 1999.  As a result of ignoring my orthopedic surgeon's advice at that time to undergo one year of physiotherapy treatment, my right leg stiffened and weakened.  This resulted in throwing off my entire body alignment, spinal column and left leg.

In my effort to return to playing tennis in 2022, I ran into setbacks related to my existing injuries.  Finally, 25 years since the injury I pursued treatment after meeting Kareem in March, 2024.  His thorough diagnosis combined with an adaptable approach that shifted to optimize my progress has been nothing short of amazing!  He adjusted treatment to compliment my progress utilizing deep tissue massage, dry needling and targeted exercises.  It has taken just 14 months to restore my function to about 90% of normal, and I believe we will get to 100%.

What matters to me is being able to play tennis unencumbered by injury.  Having worked with Kareem my game has not only improved significantly over these past 3 years - I am also now able to play 4-5 times a week without incurring a setback.  Not bad for a 70 year old!

I write this review not only to acknowledge Kareem's diagnostic and treatment skills, but to 'pay it forward'.  To those who are struggling with chronic pain and mobility issues, hesitate no further - your quality of life will be significantly improved in short order with a treatment plan tailor-made for you

There were no posture correction tips, no explanation of possible causes, no suggested stretches or exercises, and no clear next steps for managing or improving my issue.

During the session, he performed a few movements and then placed a massager on my back for about 10–15 minutes, which felt more like a temporary fix rather than real treatment.

Burlington,ChIJr7ZqOByeLIgRlLNo_Fw6gxg,Southern Ontario Animal Rehabilitation,Shannon Sylvain,5,"I can’t believe I haven’t written a review sooner - My 10 year old French bulldog Frank and I, LOVE coming to SOAR.
My dog Frank has IVDD and has chronic issues in his back end from a disc compression. He also has hip dysplasia and arthritis.
We’ve been coming to see Dr Davey since the beginning of 2025 and I couldn’t be more pleased with the services she provides for my sweet Franko. She gives Frank acupuncture, laser therapy as well as physio exercises, including the water treadmill. She is extremely hands on (I’m talking down on the ground and involved with his exercises) and it’s fantastic. She has recommended supplements and at home exercises that have helped Frank noticeably.

The only thing that might be worth noting to anyone considering SOAR for rehab/physio is that like anything pet/vet related, they are expensive. Knowing what I know now, pet insurance will be a top priority for any animal I adopt moving forward. Being self employed, I do not even have insurance for myself, let alone for my pets. After having frenchies in our family, I know now that pet insurance pays for itself in the senior years, especially in cases like these.
All that being said, the money I’ve spent at SOAR has been worth Every. Single. Penny.

Last thing I will add is that the staff in general are all so kind and patient. Every tech/assistant we’ve had in our sessions has been so caring and they all clearly have a passion for what they do.",1749575658,3 months ago,2021S05075370218.00,5370218.00

This place was amazing. I wish I had the words to describe it.
Not only did he have his own room with a bathroom, drawers, a big window, shower and desk. He also had nurses and Drs who cared.
He was able to go into a dining room to interact with others and eat with others rather than be kept in his bed.
He was monitored very closely and helped by multiple nurses.
He was given a wheelchair, walker and multiple strengthening items to help with his muscles.
He was able to go for walks (and wheels) in the garden.
He was allowed as many visitors as he wanted. Anything he needed they were there. He felt sick? The nurse helped. He needed help showering? The nurses were there.
The house keeping kept his room clean and tidy.
The drs saw him regularly to check his progress.
He was even given a social worker for his mental health.
We came from the stroke unit which was a horrible experience and everything about the rehabilitation center was the opposite.
He felt like an actual human again. After 5 weeks of being at the hospital he is now home and happy.
He goes for occupational therapy twice a week to continue to help him strengthen until he is fully mobile.
A special thank you to Jeremy who is a nurse in the stroke rehabilitation unit. He was my boyfriend's first nurse and honestly the best nurse he had. Jeremy showed he truly cared and had real compassion for his patients. Even when he wasn't my boyfriend's nurse we would see the way he was with ofher patients and it was incredible.
To the cooks in the cafeteria, you guys are amazing. You were cheerful and helpful everyday. You always made sure everyone had help eating and had the best quality meals. The dining room was always cleaned and taken care of.
Thank you to the cleaning staff who always made sure my boyfriend's garbage was taken out and the floors were clean.
And a special thank you to his Dr who checked up on him even if she didn't need to. You showed you care about your patients and always made sure my boyfriend had what he needed.
They even had a big board filled with photos of everyone's fur babies to cheer people up as they entered and existed. That was one of the best parts (for me). Seeing the look on my boyfriend's face when a new photo would get posted was amazing. A few minutes of happiness went a long way for him.

Thank you to EVERYONE at the rehabilitation center for my boyfriend's progress. A stroke is traumatic not only to a patient's body but to their mind. Everyone helped my boyfriend recover as quick as possible and made sure he was going to be okay in the long run.
I would definitely recommend this rehabilitation center to anyone who needs help with their mobility and strength. Thank you again.",1719347797,a year ago,,

I had an extremely uncomfortable and concerning experience at this physio clinic that I feel obligated to share. I was scheduled for a massage therapy session, but what unfolded was highly unprofessional and raised major safety and ethical red flags.

The massage therapist entered the room carrying his phone and laptop. He told me to undress and get ready, then left the room. I followed his instructions, undressed, and laid on the treatment bed. However, after 10 minutes, he returned only to say, “Sorry, I have to go for my lunch break,” and left me in the room alone and exposed. This was a completely inappropriate and unsafe situation.

To make matters worse, the clinic staff pressured me regarding some product they claimed I needed to have. I informed them that I already had it, but they insisted I either take theirs or “donate” mine. This felt very much like a scam, and I suspect insurance fraud may be involved based on how aggressively they pushed their product.

I would strongly advise others to stay away from this clinic. Their lack of professionalism, disregard for patient safety, and unethical behavior are unacceptable. I am considering reporting this incident to the relevant regulatory bodies.",1750959572,3 months ago,2021S05075370067.00,5370067.00

Burlington,ChIJdS1r2XRHK4gRRUAUi-HrkTk,360 Concussion Care,Katherine Lochhead,5,"I was in a motor vehicle accident in July 2024 and received a referral to 360 Concussion Care Clinic in Mississauga. Right from the initial call to book the appointment I felt supported and was able to ask any questions I had.

I arrived at the clinic and was greeted in a friendly manner. Overall, the appointment was amazing (approx 2 hours long).

I first met with a research specialist who took my blood pressure, did some balance exercises and then had me fill out some additional questionnaires.

Then I saw the Doctor that specializes in concussions and he was really nice and knowledgeable. We talked through what happened, how I have been feeling, what I can expect moving forward and did some eye and neck movement assessments/exercises. I felt heard and acknowledged. Previously, I had seen quite a few doctors since my accident and they did not specialize in concussions, therefore I was not provided with very much information and/or resources to help with my recovery.

The last part of the appointment was with an Occupational Therapist (OT). She was also very knowledgeable and understood/validated the symptoms that I had been experiencing. She shared a lot of helpful information ie. things that I should start implementing into my daily routine to help with my recovery and gave me some resources to take home with me. Following the appointment, I received an email with additional resources  as well as her support/recommendation for a  gradual return to work plan to review with my short-term disability case manager and my employer.

I also have follow up appointments with a Physiotherapist and the OT which is great.

I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone that has experienced a concussion.",1725632729,a year ago,2021S05075370223.19,5370223.19

The clinical receptionist was very rude, yelling as this was one hour before the appointment and that she will be fully charging me for cancellation. Although, I told her that she had no ill symptoms earlier and that I could bring her to the appointment as long as they are okay with it. The lady started yelling saying we don't want your sick daughter around us. ""You cannot bring her, DO NOT bring her"" with a very high pitched tone, and added that she will charge us anyways. This was just so unacceptable when they did not want my ""sick daughter around"" but they would still charge.

Burlington,ChIJCSynd2SbLIgR2mGSTq3dsBk,CBI Health - Hamilton Landsdale,jeza,5,"Ola is seriously one of the best! He’s so nice, super funny, and made every session something to actually look forward to (which I never thought I’d say about physio lol). He treated both me and my sister and made sure everything was tailored to our individual needs. Whenever things started getting easier, he’d switch up the exercises to keep us challenged in a good way (even planks which I hated lol). You can tell he really knows what he’s doing but still keeps the vibe light and comfortable. I’d definitely recommend! Mckayla in the front desk is amazing aswell! She’s very understanding when it comes to appointments, and she’ll kindly switch your appointment, call/text to remind you, and follow up on you incase life got too busy! She made this whole experience way more comfortable for us. We wish the best for both of them, thank you!!!!",1752548817,2 months ago,,

Since sustaining a back injury in May, I have gone from barely being able to walk from pain to essentially pain-free. I attribute this to not just my sessions with Ola but his advice and guidance on how to prevent pain/re-injury between sessions and moving forward.

Burlington,ChIJ8X-4m6FnK4gRoCeTugrIP60,Work-Fit Total Therapy Centre,Neil Smith,2,"I’m giving Work Fit at the Oakville Hospital 2 stars and it’s not because of the quality of the physiotherapy. The two PTs and their Assistants were amazing: a special shout out to Binu (ask for him if you can).

The problem is the administration of the clinic. Why a resident in Long Term Care on 3N cannot access the services thru private pay is incomprehensible. Do you want business or not?  I guess you didn’t want mine. Totally discriminatory and this policy needs to change. If an inpatient in LTC can afford private pay, what the hell does the clinic care if the person lives outside the hospital or is just visiting.

Because of the archaic policies of this clinic, my mobility suffered greatly as the inpatient PT is woeful for seniors.

So thanks a lot for nothing, WF (specifically Huda). And you still owe me $55 for that appointment you cancelled on me that you made me pre-pay for.

BTW - everyone on the third floor in the north building is cheesed that they can’t use your services. Way to run a business.",1754732670,a month ago,2021S05075350615.00,5350615.00

From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and at ease. The entire team is professional, friendly, and clearly passionate about helping people feel their best.

Giancarlo took the time to listen to my concerns, explain everything clearly, and develop a treatment plan that was tailored specifically to my needs. After just a few sessions, I noticed a significant improvement in my pain, posture, and overall well-being.

What I appreciated most was the genuine care and attention I received—not just a quick adjustment and out the door. It’s rare to find a practitioner who combines expertise with such compassion and respect for their patients.

Burlington,ChIJg5y57ylDK4gRk1pyts-m928,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Oakville South,andre bennett,1,"Worst clinic ever!!!! Went there hoping to get injections in my hips, shoulder and help with my knee. Because I had multiple issues, I had to get separate referrals for each body part I needed help with. This costed me many trips back and fourth from my doctor getting referrals. After that got taken care of I finally got my first appointment. Unfortunately they also need to make separate appointments for each body part as well (not all at once) which also required constant trips back and fourth. This issue with that is the doctors there only work one day a week, the other maybe twice a week. Also I should add their latest appointment I like 3pm. This caused me to miss lots of time at work leaving for an appointment and then going back to work. Which didn’t go very well with my employer. This went on for over a month with multiple appointments with both doctors and absolutely no treatment. Constantly went to an appointment and then got told to make another appointment to be able to go any further with treatment. Finally by the last appointment, I was very excited that I may finally get the treatment that I’ve been waiting for since I started going there. Because it was essentially my first appointment for this specific body part. I was told “you guessed it” that I had to make yet another appointment if I wanted to be treated! Completely frustrated at this point. I just sat there pretty upset listening to what the doctor had to say, said ok, then asked if I could leave. To which she said “yes”. This is where it really gets interesting! I later get a text message saying all my further appointments have been cancelled due to abusive behaviour towards staff. Shocked and confused, I called the office to ask what was going on? Was told by front clerk that the doctor (Dr Manisha Sachdeva) wrote in her notes that “I was not receptive to the information she was giving” and that “I walked out half way during the appointment”.  Don’t know how that constitutes as abusive behaviour. But anyway I immediately I went on to explain that I literally started doing the exercises that she suggested right after leaving the clinic and that I literally asked her if I could leave, to which she said “yes” and THEN I left. Sure maybe I was upset which I had every right to be. But I never showed her any disrespect, never said anything inappropriate, literally did nothing wrong! In fact, I told the person on the phone if anything I’m the one being disrespected in this situation. She went on to say “well you’ve been referred to another clinic, so deal
with them now” with absolutely no remorse. I replied with “ that’s fine I wasn’t coming back anyways, but please don’t say that I was being abusive. I literally did nothing wrong” she said Ok and pretty much hung up the phone on me. I know this has been very lengthy but I really needed to create the context. Do not waist your time with this clinic! I literally booked an appointment with another clinic already and have an appointment the next day with the promise of treatment. 24 hours as apposed to 5-6weeks. Athletes care DOES NOT CARE!!! Especially Dr Manisha Sachdeva. If she cared even a little, she would adjust her schedule to maybe an 11-7 or 10-6 shift so she can at least accommodate for her patients that work a 9-5 type job. Especially since she only works one day a week... NOPE! They expect you to take the time out of your job to accommodate their hours. Even if it costs you multiple times back and fourth with no treatment. WORST CLINIC EVER!!!",1758066153,a week ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

Burlington,ChIJpVA22lFDK4gR8QjKCdmpBQg,Regenerative Health Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,Jacqueline Zonneville,2,"I’ve been dealing with debilitating, chronic pain since seeing Dr. Kings in May 2023, initially for help with tendon tears in my left glute. While he was quick to identify the tears in my left glute and hamstring and provide needed PRP treatment (which worked), I continued experiencing similar pain on the right side, which he dismissed and attributed to nerve issues rather than tendon damage. He did submit a requisite for a lumbar spine MRI and said he could be of no further help until after that. The whole time I knew the right side was also tendon related. So, after two+ years now of seeking treatment from various chiros, physios, etc. for both my spine disc issues and glute pain, I was finally diagnosed with tendon tears in the EXACT spot I flagged to Dr. Kings back in 2023. In the meantime, my right leg basically mummified in pain and restriction and my pain levels were consistently 10/10 (as a former athlete, I had to use a cane to walk last summer). Another sports medicine doctor has since started treatment with a series of PRPs, and I’m hopeful for recovery (since there are now a series of partial tears in my R glute/hamstring tendons and my body has gone through severe trauma so the mechanics are all impacted!). While Dr. Kings is clearly skilled, I didn’t feel like he truly cared about my well-being after addressing only part of my issues. I felt gaslit, unheard and left to navigate and advocate for myself. It’s been a long, frustrating and very painful journey, and though I considered returning to Dr. Kings for further care in 2024, I felt the treatment I needed was not fully addressed by him during our time together (or I wouldn't be in this whole mess). The toll this chronic pain has taken on my mental and physical health (and wallet) has been significant.",1748377666,4 months ago,2021S05075350612.10,5350612.10

You're not just treated during your appointment - you’re given clear, practical exercises to continue your recovery between sessions. These exercises are thoroughly demonstrated and explained, and they’re even emailed to you with video links to ensure you’re doing them correctly at home.

Reply to you on my review- Thank you for your response. I understand the charges were communicated to me, but my concern is the long wait time just to receive consultation notes, even though I did not need to see a doctor. Additionally, I was charged $120 during a previous visit, which makes me question the consistency of your fees.

She recognized the signs of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and made thoughtful, informed suggestions to help me manage it—something I’ve never experienced before. Knowing she has a sister with EDS gave me so much comfort, because it meant she gets it. She understands what it’s like to be dismissed, misdiagnosed, or misunderstood. That level of empathy is rare, and it meant everything to me. I genuinely ugly cried in her office because it was the first time I felt truly heard.

Burlington,ChIJB5OV53BeK4gRYjqJZJiT_98,Precision Sport & Spine,Jennifer Alex,1,"My experience with Dr Fennel was deeply disappointing and concerning. At my first appointment, I was not given the opportunity to discuss my medical history or clarify my symptoms. Dr F mainly asked a series of yes/no questions and provided only a minimal physical examination before recommending a steroid injection. When I tried to share relevant background and past MRI results, it felt like my input was dismissed and the decision had already been made.

In light of recent serious incidents—including a patient death following a nerve block procedure under his care, and numerous negative public reviews—I am troubled that there appears to be no visible accountability or corrective action regarding his practice. These experiences do not align with patient-centered care, shared decision-making, or informed consent—all basic standards that patients should be able to expect.

If others have encountered similar substandard encounters, I strongly urge them to document and report their experiences to the relevant regulatory authorities. Timely investigation and accountability can help ensure patient safety and maintain trust in our healthcare system.",1758854949,in the last week,2021S05075350610.03,5350610.03

He asked me from one to 10 how bad is my pain ? I said 10 because to me it was a 10, he asked me if I had a hot poker in my eye would I still be standing there ? He kept saying only your back pain, well that day I had pain all over including my low back , he wanted me to give him a number one to 10 so I said 7, after injections he asked again , and I replied I feel numb but he wanted a number so I said 4 . He escorted me out and when his assistant called me if I was tracking my pain I said  no because I was not even aware I was suppose to , I just said I still felt pain and I was told over the phone by a male assistant that Dr Fennell would not be seeing me anymore.

Just wanted to update. I am truly grateful for the amazing care and pain management I have from my treatments. I also want to address comments about his bedside manner. He is not a doctor to hand out narcotics. He will not write you prescriptions for Percocetts.
He is about alternatives. I went in and I knew he was ""screening"" me to see if I was there to get better and help myself or just give me drugs. Yes, he can be abrupt but only if he knows you aren't willing to do the work, try alternatives and he knows if you have done the work at home. Once Dr. F knew I was serious and saw me trying, his demeanor changed. Unfortunately doctor's who deal in pain management are visited by so many people who just want a pill to ""fix"" them.

I’ve been seeing Disha for over a year now, and honestly, she has been a lifesaver. I never really believed in physiotherapy until I met her.

I was struggling with severe issues in my hands (especially my thumbs). I couldn’t sleep, work, or function properly. After about six months of consistent therapy, I’m now 99% healed—it’s mostly just maintenance at this point. I started with twice-weekly sessions, then moved down to once a week, and now I only need to see her about every two weeks for my hands. I can’t put into words how grateful I am for the difference she has made.

More recently, I developed a Baker’s cyst behind my knee that left me in extreme pain. Both my family physician and a rheumatologist recommended physiotherapy, so of course I went straight to Disha. After just two visits, my pain has already reduced by more than half—I could hardly
believe it!

Disha’s expertise, care, and dedication have truly changed my life. If you’re in need of physiotherapy and looking for someone who is genuinely amazing at what they do, I can’t recommend her enough. I’m forever thankful for her help. 😌",1756498981,4 weeks ago,2021S05075350511.02,5350511.02

Burlington,ChIJDwkTkFhhK4gRbKfcaBK2Gbg,Rise Rehabilitation and Performance Centre,Howard Wark,5,"As a golfer in my 60s, I found that golfing had gradually become more challenging. It seemed normal at first—just part of aging—but the stiffness, loss of distance, and persistent discomfort in my low back, shoulders, and elbows started taking away from my enjoyment of the game. Long rounds and regular play only seemed to make things worse, and I struggled to stay in posture, constantly compensating because of limitations in my hips, upper back, and shoulders.
That's when I decided to visit Dr. Jeff Smeaton for an assessment. He quickly identified the underlying issues causing my pain and inefficiencies in my swing. Rather than just prescribing stretches, he emphasized targeted exercises designed to improve the awareness, control, and coordination of my problem areas.
Under Dr. Smeaton’s guidance, I began a program of manual treatments combined with a customized home routine. These exercises helped me regain crucial mobility and stability, significantly reducing the stress on my back and joints. I learned how to effectively use the ground to rotate my hips without sacrificing posture or comfort.
The results have been impressive—I’ve gained 4 mph in swing speed, my ball-striking has become far more consistent, and, best of all, the persistent discomfort in my back, shoulders, and elbows has greatly diminished. I'm now golfing comfortably, efficiently, and confidently again.
I highly recommend Dr. Smeaton to any golfer experiencing stiffness or discomfort, especially those like me who want to keep playing pain-free and enjoy golf to the fullest as we age.",1744653104,5 months ago,2021S05075350612.01,5350612.01

I’m grateful Dr. Jeff Smeaton  works at Burloak Indoor Golf  and was there for me in some very dark, immobile hours.

I first visited Dr. Smeaton in Spring 2024 dealing with persistent mid-back pain caused largely by intensive training as I prepared to do the PAT (Playing Ability Test) to get into the PGA of Canada. Most recently, he provided guidance for home relief when faced with an unexpected severe lower back injury.

🤝 I connected with Jeff immediately. He’s an overall great guy, a hockey dad and cares about his patients.

🧠 He took the time to assess and identify underlying physical imbalances contributing to my injury. He developed a customized treatment and rehabilitation plan specifically tailored to my needs.

🦵The treatment improved my body awareness dramatically. I began to understand my stability and positioning much better, allowing me to maintain proper posture and generate greater width and ease in my swing.

I highly recommend Dr. Smeaton to any golfer dealing with pain or injury who wants not just relief, but lasting improvements in their game and overall health.

He is moving to our new location, and will have a team dedicated to helping golfers feel and move better. Stoked for the future!

Dr. Girgis is kind, caring and listens to patients properly but the amount of wait time goes in collecting the medicines is more than double the time we have to wait for doctor consultation. In my scenario, I was the only patient inside the clinic and just to give a couple of medicines they took more than 30mins. The reason they stated was, they were training the new staff by keeping the patient waiting. I was not sure, if they were getting the medicines from the shelves or if they were manufacturing the medicines by themselves. Receptionist is good, doctors are amazing but they need to be quick in Pharmacy services.

I felt very comforted by knowing that Kathryn and Robert have treated Bell's Palsy before, and they exceeded my expectations as my treatment continued. They are very knowledgeable, skillful, and at the same time, very kind, reassuring, respectful, and comforting. I noticed my condition improving after every treatment, and am shocked and super happy with how quickly it is improving! The laser acupuncture/ electro-myopulse treatment works wonders and is backed by scientists, and Kathryn's face and neck massages helped tremendously with relieving the tightness and discomfort I felt due to my condition.

Burlington,ChIJ28u9yPZGK4gROBFiciY0_MI,Dynamic Physiotherapy & Sports Injury Clinic Inc,Dani,1,"Wouldn't recommend. I went there for treatment related to quite a serious motor vehicle accident. I have chronic back pain from a spinal fracture and migraines/headaches from a scalp laceration.

Most appointmentswith Kathryn and Robert lasted less than an hour, no one did any physiotherapy with me. Just used machines that aren't clinically proven to work, and made me ride a bike and bounce on a trampoline and lift weights. Where is the therapy in that??

I tried asking them about my joint pain from my hyper mobility as well. Asking if certain braces would help, and asking for exercises. But Kathryn seemed to pretend like she didn't understand. And when she ""did understand"" she said she couldn't do anything to help. ""There's nothing to do"". But now I've been referred to an EDS hyper mobility clinic by my doctor. It felt like she just didn't want to do her job.

They were also very unprofessional and had quite lazy behavior. They did maybe one or two good treatment sessions and then just decided to stop trying. And my treatment wasn't working.  I eventually just stopped showing up and they didn't even call to see why. They don't care about treatment. Just money. Robert was even complaining to me about my insurance not covering certain HST. That's your problem bud, not mine.

On top of that, it's only the two of them working there. Husband and wife, and sometimes their son. It's pretty strange, and the dynamic is weird. Like you can tell when they've had an argument that morning. I don't like this place at all, and I feel like there's something else going on there.

0 stars if I could. PLEASE go somewhere else. Find a decent clinic that will actually help your pain and struggles. Don't waste anxiety on this clinic.",1724809844,a year ago,2021S05075350513.03,5350513.03

Burlington,ChIJ28u9yPZGK4gROBFiciY0_MI,Dynamic Physiotherapy & Sports Injury Clinic Inc,Brandon,1,"The worst physiotherapy place I have ever been to. I typically am not the one to leave reviews (on anything to be honest), but I feel its necessary in this particular case.

To start - I scheduled my appointment online, and they called me on the day-of to re-book me for a different time slot that day. I didn't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with waiting an hour to see someone once I arrived at the clinic...

Once the physiotherapist entered the room, she rushed my diagnosis in the matter of 30 seconds or so, then attached these electrodes to my arm (A therapy which is proven to not have any scientific benefit by the way). Then when I asked to just focus on the root cause of the issue and what I can do to help it, she said they didn't have time to do a proper assessment and that I would have to come back at another time next week... Why should I have to pay for another appointment because they couldn't properly schedule me in the first time?? Also why do they not focus on the root cause of the issue in the first appointment?

The clinic is also not very well designed. Patient rooms are separated by curtains taken straight out of a hospital ER, so you can hear multiple people next to you and you have virtually zero privacy. I get the feeling this place is run like an assembly line, which the goal is to get people in and out as quickly as possible without actually helping them, and not addressing the root cause of their symptoms so they keep coming back...

After having this terrible experience they thankfully did offer me a full refund, which I took. I have recently seen a much better physiotherapist who was able to properly assess my condition, help me recover to the point where I am able to start playing baseball again!

Please, save your time and money and go to a different place.",1689646687,2 years ago,2021S05075350513.03,5350513.03

Burlington,ChIJ_8tUjFZhK4gRRkS9VLRnN0M,Endorphins Health and Wellness Centre,Fel Rocci,5,"In April, 1999 I had ACL surgery on my right knee following a tennis injury.  I made a huge mistake by ignoring my orthopedic surgeon's advice to start physiotherapy immediately.  After one year of delaying treatment my right leg became severely stiff and weakened, which threw off my entire body alignment, spinal column, and left leg.

Fast forward 25 years to March, 2024 when I met Kareem.  His thorough diagnosis and willingness to adapt his approach has been incredible.  The combination of deep tissue massage, dry needling, and targeted exercises has really helped.  In just 14 months he's restored me to about 90% of normal function, and I believe we'll get to 100%.

What really matters to me is tennis.  I have been trying to get back to playing for three years but kept having setbacks and injuries.  Since working with Kareem I have not only improved my game but can now play 4-5 times a week without getting hurt.  Not bad for a 70-year-old!

I am incredibly grateful to Kareem for his expertise and support.  If you're struggling with chronic pain or mobility issues, don't wait 25 years like I did - I highly recommend him.

Burlington,ChIJ7ZckDSSZLIgRMT3lj6Puueg,Canadian Academy of Osteopathy Student Clinic,Carole Chapple,5,"I AM LOVING MY TREATMENTS AT CAO!
As a patient for a few years, I have been faithfully attended the clinic once a week.  The student practitioners are so helpful and I go home feeling great.  I have told them I wish I could stay on the table all day I get so relaxed.
The student staff get to the root of the problem (mine is sciatica mainly) and try to correct it through bending, stretching and manipulating the area back to normality.  There is the odd student I have had who was not as effective for me (not enough pressure etc) but they are still learning in their fourth and final year of training.  Bottom line is I am grateful for these gifted people with healing hands as they learn the important work of how our bodies function.  They value us as much as we do them.
The clinic supervisor is a great help as she goes around to give any advice and techniques needed to assist her students.
Last but not least, staff is always cheerful, helpful, dressed professionally in white and black uniforms and the skilfully run office is there for assistance when needed.

Like another reviewer said, I had hardly entered and was immediately asked what my name was. No greeting, no welcome, no smile. This continued even after the massage ended & I came back to the reception for payment. It was like she had a problem that I was there. Didn’t even respond when I greeted on my way out.

Burlington,ChIJnQBmZ6-bLIgRi0GxaAdUTbI,Livelong Wellness Clinic,Aileen Black,1,"I recently visited LiveLong Wellness Clinic for acupuncture to help alleviate a migraine.

My appointment was delayed by 35 minutes, and once I saw the acupuncturist, I explained I was experiencing a migraine. I was asked to remove my shirt, which made me uncomfortable as I've never had to undress for acupuncture before. During the treatment, the acupuncturist shouted ""ok?"" each time he inserted a needle in my feet and legs. This was overwhelming given my heightened sensitivity to sound during a migraine.

I asked for needles to be placed in my head, as this had helped in past treatments, but the acupuncturist insisted my migraine was related to my stomach. Although he eventually placed the needles in my head, the experience was distressing. I requested quiet time to let the treatment take effect, but the door was left open, and I could hear conversations in the waiting area, making it impossible to relax. Less than 10 minutes later, he returned and shouted that ""this should work, I have been doing this for over 30 years"". I still had a migraine, became emotional and started to cry. His response was to call me ""sensitive.""

After paying and letting the receptionist know about the experience, I left.

When I returned home, I discovered two needles were left in my head, which was alarming.

This experience left me feeling unheard and unsupported during a time when I was already in significant pain. I hope the clinic can take steps to ensure that patients in fragile states receive more compassionate and attentive care.

It just made me feel instantly relaxed and like I was in a really good space. The staff were also just lovely – super professional but also really welcoming, which made the whole experience so much nicer.
I had a session with CiCi, and I have to say, she was amazing. I'd been dealing with this nagging tension in my neck and shoulders for ages, and her technique really did the trick. I could actually feel the pain easing up as she worked, which was such a relief. It wasn't just a superficial massage; you could tell she knew what she was doing.
I walked out of there feeling so much better, and honestly, I'm already planning my next appointment.

Burlington,ChIJmxnRjuZdK4gRMW2ud-L_gbg,Ye's Acupuncture & Wellness Clinic,Leyla GG,5,"My review will be a bit long but I need to explain in detail what Judy did for me. I went to her in January/February 2025. As I came in, she took the time to listen to everything I had to explain and understood the energy/spiritual aspect of the healing I needed, not just having “pain” compare to others acupuncturists.
I had an issue with my tongue since 2023 after alcohol intoxication, doctor told me I was allergic and to stop drinking ever again,
she proposed to me an herbal remedy which I took not completely yet and while doing it my tongue already went almost all back to normal 85% I would say with the little I took so far, (I need to continue and finish all the tea. She can give you the remedy but we have to follow through with it as she will explain how to do it). But it is a worry less in my mind.

She really is an amazing doctor in my eyes. My point is to not be ashamed or to not leave any details when you go see her, be open and explain because I am pretty sure she will have a cure.

I was suppose to continue my acupuncture treatment which I only did 2 so far, because I lost my job and need to get that sorted first, but as soon as I can I will be back to her and cannot wait to continue healing along with her.
I write this review now because it has been on my mind and I want everyone who is seeking a real healing place in GTA to go see her, you won’t be disappointed. I am very glad I found her and she will be my go to anytime.

She reduced my anxiety tremendously and helped me let go of stuck emotions especially in my spleen area.
I hope anyone who is desperate or can’t seem to find the right person to heal them see this and try to go see her.

All the best Judy, hopefully I will see you soon again!

Judy Ye stands out as, in my opinion, the most professional acupuncturist in Canada. Her expertise was instrumental in addressing both my upper and lower back pain issues.

Moving away from Ontario, one of the most disheartening aspects for me was the inability to continue treatment with Judy. Her approach to acupuncture was not just effective but transformative in relieving my persistent back pain.

Judy's mastery in acupuncture is unparalleled, and the impact of her treatments on my well-being was remarkable. I sorely miss the quality of care I received under her guidance.

Burlington,ChIJW3nto2NhK4gRKebi_8FWaVw,Burlington Skin & Wellness,Morgan,1,"This office should be ashamed of themselves. I was referred to Dr. Wong for a bump on my face that turned out to be skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma. Dr. Wong identified the lesion accurately and quickly. I appreciated his straight forward nature and honesty. After this diagnosis I asked his nurse if they could check the rest of my body to be sure I didn’t have cancer spots anywhere else and they told me no, I would need a new referral for that. Fine. I went to my Doctor for a new referral, asked my Dr what the derm nurse told me to ask for, but was informed today by reception at this office that my referral was declined because there wasn’t one specific lesion indicated and that they don’t perform exams for skin cancer. They tried to upsell me on paying for an annual mole mapping service and said they don’t perform OHIP covered routine skin exams, even in high risk patients with a history of skin cancer. This is the most outlandish thing I’ve ever heard from a medical dermatology office. I want to know if I have further undiagnosed skin cancer _at this present moment_; the point of mole mapping tracks changes _over time_. Fine for further monitoring but not what I need right now. After speaking with a couple friends who have had bcc as well, they get OHIP covered scans by their dermatologist every 6-12 months.

The day of my mohs surgery to remove my existing cancer, the surgeon at a different clinic in Oakville identified 2 other spots on my face of concern, one she thought looked potentially like melanoma (very dark with an atypical shape) and one that looks like another early stage bcc. She took a biopsy of the spot she worried could be melanoma and asked me to monitor the other potential bcc spot for 6 months for changes. These spots were either missed by this office or ignored because I didn’t have separate referrals for every square cm of my skin. I’m now dealing with 3 cancerous/potentially cancerous lesions on my face alone and this office is refusing to see me, an existing patient, for an exam to rule out further existing cancer. I am covered head to toe in freckles and moles, getting a referral for each one is insanity. Beyond this their reception is the worst I’ve ever seen. For starters I had to call them to find out my referral was declined, they didn’t notify me OR my referring GP of this decision themselves. They’re difficult to get ahold of most of the time and their telephone receptionists are consistently unhelpful/uninformed. Dr. Wong is a good dermatologist, knows what he’s talking about, but this office is a mess. They’ve prioritized profit over my healthcare and have been a headache to deal with start to finish.",1745441140,5 months ago,2021S05075370224.03,5370224.03

Burlington,ChIJrWQ2ooOXLIgRjFt4m7C2A20,Lococo Wellness Clinic,Julia Armenti,5,"I had such a positive experience at Lococo Wellness Clinic with Dr. Lococo. She has a way of making you feel truly heard - she asks thoughtful questions that no other doctor has ever asked me and really takes the time to understand the whole picture of your health. It’s clear that her focus is on getting to the root of concerns rather than just managing symptoms.

One of my biggest struggles has been Raynaud’s disease and circulation issues, which have made daily life extremely challenging over the past few years. Despite trying countless approaches, nothing ever gave me relief. On top of that, I’ve dealt with stubborn acne since my teenage years. I completed a live blood cell analysis at the clinic, and from there Dr. Lococo created a personalized protocol tailored to what my body truly needed. After just three months of following her advice, the improvements have been incredible - my skin is clearer, and most importantly, my circulation has improved in ways I never thought possible. The changes in my Raynaud’s symptoms have been life-changing, and I’m beyond grateful to finally have relief after years of struggling.

I’m so grateful for Dr. Lococo’s care and I would highly recommend her and Lococo Wellness Clinic to anyone looking for compassionate, natural, and truly effective holistic care!!",1756240344,a month ago,,

I first saw Kyle for a massage, and he was so professional, welcoming, and really listened to my needs. He took the time to explain what he was doing, checked in to make sure I was comfortable, and tailored the session to what my body actually needed rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

He was honest enough to refer me to Anesto (osteopath), who continued my care with the same level of professionalism. He creates a warm and safe environment, and has a real ability to pull back the layers to get to the root of the issue while still making me feel supported and understood.

I have also been working with Trevor (chiropractor), who is fantastic. His assessment was thorough, and he took the time to find the root cause of my issue. I have been seeing him for the past month. His adjustments are gentle yet effective, and he always explains what he is doing before each step. He has a calm and reassuring approach that puts me at ease, and I leave each session feeling relieved and more confident in my recovery.

Today was my first time seeing Z (physiotherapist), and he was thorough, attentive, and encouraging. He took the time to assess my needs, explained the exercises clearly, and created a plan that felt tailored to me. I left the session feeling supported and confident about the next steps in my recovery.

Each of them brings their own expertise and compassion to my recovery. I really appreciate how seamlessly the team work together and how supported I feel every step of the way.

It was not my expectation for that to happen, but I must say I was really impressed with the accountability and Just the professionalism in this day and age that goes such a long way, especially in a time where customer service has kind of gone to the fritz it’s extremely refreshing to know that I chose a location that I’m hoping will be up to standards with Oakville and or Yorkville even if in Mississauga the next time I go.

Etobicoke,ChIJ0z6DX9PM1IkROTdnJgccAWw,Global Health Physiotherapy Clinic,Mykeisha Marie,5,"When I got into a car accident two months ago, I never thought that I'd be stumbling upon such a great establishment like the Global Health Physiotherapy Clinic. Michael, Parisa and Binal have been so caring and supportive throughout my journey back to recovery and I am truly grateful for all of them. Working as a frontline worker comes with a great amount of physical and emotional stress that came full circle when I was struck by a moving vehicle back in April 2025. After going through this experience, I had internal injuries going on but thankfully nothing on me was broken.

After a quick Google search, I found GHP Clinic (well...it found me😌) and my road to recovery began. Michael made me feel heard, seen and truly cared for. Parisa and Binal have been very supportive of me as well; asking questions like the scale level of pain I was experiencing each session, pushing me to do all of the required exercises, stretches, and even giving me small cups of water when I was thirsty. Moving forward, they all understood how physically hurt I was, but once I admitted to them that it became more emotional for me, they all reminded me that GHP is also a safe space. I will never forget coming to GHP clinic and working with people that truly care about their clients. They've truly made a difference and I would recommend anyone who's been in a traumatic situation or is hesitant upon going to GHP clinic to go. You will not be disappointed💕✨

I took a picture of Mr. Liougas's quote that he posted on the wall at my last session and I instantly fell in love with it. It's truly inspiring. Thank you Michael, Parisa and Binal for taking care of me💕✨",1750107261,3 months ago,2021S05075350128.02,5350128.02

I’m a hair stylist so any physical issue REALLY affects my ability to work and a shoulder injury makes it pretty much impossible. So after this accident the pain was so intense I could barely use my left arm, couldn’t sleep or even walk sometimes the pain from even that much movement was too intense-
I’ve never experienced anything like it and I tried a few fixes but it was only when my insurance sent me to Trilogy for physio that it started getting better FAST- I saw Rob there on my first appt and he did dry needling which was totally new to me but immediately helped- i have since recommended ROB to other people and everyone has circled back to me to tell me how much he helped them- one friend (also a hairstylist) said she’d had chronic pain for years and she recently messaged me to say how much better she felt (and might have used the word miracle)

So I’d recommend him to anyone with an issue but from personal experience I think anyone in my industry; hairdressers, makeup artists, stylists-because our jobs are SO physical- could absolutely benefit from getting on a plan with Rob - he has helped me so much- he’s so technical and knowledgeable and I can’t recommend him enough.",1757906765,a week ago,2021S05075350217.00,5350217.00

Etobicoke,ChIJZwQbOCA0K4gRqejEPXvzS_E,Body Co.,Mabel Stussi,5,I was 6m postpartum and needed help with my pelvic floor. I'm glad I was recommended to body co because I wasn't aware there were physio specialists like Alisha who provided specific care to these issues. I quickly saw improvement after the first session and it made me aware of what I needed to work on. I highly recommend Alisha and getting specialized postpartum physio for pelvic floor because some times exercises alone doesn't always cut it.,1755848405,a month ago,2021S05075350105.00,5350105.00

Receptionist work really well around your schedule and always text you a day before to remind you of your appointment’s and if you’re able to attend. Since this has been my first ever accident and ever going through all of this, I always have questions for Iryna & she is always a text away for any questions or concerns I may have.

Nina, another receptionist is always willing to write down my appointments on a sticky note and or text me my appointment for me when I book them.

Natalia is the osteopathic masseuse, who always greets you with a smile and is very knowledgeable at what she does. Even though her practice isn’t like a massage at a spa, she makes the experience very relaxing with music and asks you before starting where you’re experiencing pain.

The physiotherapy Doctor , is very knowledgeable and also asks where you are feeling pain to work in that spot, that session. Uses a shockwave machine on the spot that is causing you pain, uses bio freeze to help with the pain and gives you helpful exercise tips, to do at home.

I highly recommend this clinic as you will be treated as family and treated highly with care.

I’d like to thank Dun-dix for helping me through my road to recovery 🙏🏽

And would personally like to congratulate all the ladies, who work in the front for all their dedication and hard work you give daily.

Thank you!

Etobicoke,ChIJg_5qZyQ2K4gRi_SxKdvD4xs,Mimico Medical Family Doctor & Physiotherapy,Colleen Booker,1,"I’ve never had a more frustrating experience trying to access basic care. I called Mimico Medical after suffering a severe back injury that left me unable to get out of bed, requesting a virtual appointment with my doctor just to obtain a medical note. The reception staff flatly told me it “wasn’t a medical emergency” — yet somehow still suggested I go to an emergency clinic. That made no sense. If it’s not urgent, why suggest the ER?

Their lack of empathy and basic logic was shocking. They were completely unwilling to help accommodate a virtual visit, even though that would’ve been the safest and simplest solution.

What’s worse — I’ve seen other patients visibly upset while at the clinic, saying they couldn’t get through on the phones to book appointments. When I was there in person, not a single phone was ringing. So why aren’t calls being answered?

The medical staff here may be good, but the reception is a serious bottleneck to getting any help. If you’re sick, in pain, or in urgent need of support, don’t expect this front desk to have your back — literally or figuratively.",1756218874,a month ago,2021S05075350209.00,5350209.00

I have been a patient here for years, and the experience has only gotten worse. Communication is nonexistent. There’s no direct person to call, and the front desk is worse than any automated system I’ve encountered. Basic requests—like getting a fax or a copy of your own records—are met with “I’m not sure what I can retrieve.” There is absolutely no system for follow-ups or email responses; whether you get an answer is pure luck.

Politeness or patience doesn’t matter. The staff clearly has no commitment to improving their processes or patient experience. The only reason I remain a patient is because Dr. Luca is phenomenal, but the clinic itself is completely dysfunctional. Save yourself the frustration—this is the worst clinic experience I’ve ever had.",1757515298,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350209.00,5350209.00

Regardless of circumstances they rush you out in 15 mins.  Thin walls so you can hear very private convos going on in rooms next to you.  $165 to fill up a form that required one sentence and 3 check boxes checked, took 5 mins to populate.  They can’t handle mental health issues and label patients as difficult instead of being doctors trained to handle mental health.  For severe perimenopause symptoms, the female doctor kept minimizing my pain and basically telling me I am just aging and I should just deal.  Horrible bed side manner.

I left this clinic a year ago and it was the best decision for my medical healing journey.  My doctor now actually CARES, she doesn’t charge me for paper work.  She has amazing empathy and bed side manner.  If you live in this area go to LAMP on fifth street.  I am better now thanks to the amazing doctors and nurse practitioners at LAMP, but people should be warned about this clinic.

After an extensive search for a qualified physiotherapist to help with scoliosis treatment, we’ve tried numerous clinics and practitioners. I’m so grateful we were referred to Dr. Nikolai. He is a highly skilled and knowledgeable professional who blends various physiotherapy techniques with massage therapy in a way that’s both effective and personalized.

After just three months of treatment, we’ve already seen remarkable, visible improvements, which have been confirmed by several independent doctors. One thing that truly sets Dr. Nikolai apart is his punctuality—every appointment starts on time, and we always feel that our concerns are addressed with his undivided attention.

I also greatly appreciate the thoughtful guidance we received regarding daily exercises. Dr. Nikolai took the time to recommend exercises that are helpful for scoliosis and advised on which gym routines to avoid.

Beyond his expertise, the atmosphere in his clinic is always welcoming and friendly, making each visit a pleasant experience.

Throughout my recovery, I repeatedly asked for massages and they kept pushing me toward acupuncture. Not for my health, but because it brings them more money from my insurance plan. Now that my funds are nearly run dry, I am finding out where all the insurance money went. Their treatments are usually brief and the exercise portion is a joke.

Etobicoke,ChIJTW34noE2K4gRf6punuHxumA,Bloor West,Lynn Edwards,2,"Most disappointing physio therapy experience ever. I have had physio therapy in several parts of Canada plus all over the GTA and this was the worst. Fortunately, the physio assistants who do all the work with patients are the saving grace of this organization. BUT everything else is terrible. The actual physiotherapist who is supposed to diagnose got an easy pass with me because I already had an ultra sound and an xray so he was paid for doing nothing and he did NOTHING. The exercise ‘program’ is pathetic. One session, 3 exercises and that's it for the entire  treatment program. I am accustomed to new and progressively more challenging exercises WITH EACH APPOINTMENT. NOT ONE AND THEN YOU ARE DONE. But I save the best for last. RECEPTION. It’s one of those client service organizations which hates clients. Almost before you approach the reception counter, you are ORDERED to take a seat. The delivery is horrendous. It should sound like “Good day Mr. Smith, I see you are here for your appointment. Feel free to sit in the waiting area until the therapist arrives”. That’s how it should sound. INSTEAD, what you get is no acknowledgement, no greeting, no polite smile. But you do get an order to “HAVE A SEAT” which to me sounded like “oh, another boring client. Get out of my face and I ORDER  YOU TO HAVE A SEAT”. I have seen that same pitiful customer service when I have had no other choice but to go to a walk in clinic. If Bloor West Physio cares at all about it’s reputation, they will revise their reception practices. I managed to complete the entire program which did very  little for me. I have since returned to a clinic which understands customer service and TREATMENT. The two treatments I have had since finishing with Bloor West Physio have already helped more than the 8 weeks I wasted at Bloor West Physio.

Avoid this place. Extremely negative experience. It’s already hard enough to deal with an accident and insurance companies as it is; but this place is a mess. They only focus on signing you in and taking your money and benefits.
Girl at the desk kept messing up not only my paperwork, but also billing and amounts for my girlfriend as well. Not to mention how rude she is.
Owners seem nice but don’t really care. They also treat employees like garbage in front of the patients. No wonder they’re so miserable.
I attended this clinic for months and eventually realized I had to move. On some occasions there was no heating, others no AC, sometimes not even electricity!!! This is crucial when you’re  suffering a physical illness.
Couple of times the employees were fighting a flock of pigeons that live in the ceiling. Another time, to my surprise, they also found a family of raccoons living inside the walls and ceiling which took all the employees fighting then with brooms to get them out. No expert, but I’m sure that’s gotta be some type of health or safety violation.
No one supervises your therapy. You’re just given pictures and told to go do them on your own at the back.
I was given massage, chiropractor and physiotherapist by my insurance. This place promised to provide these services. Once I began attending, the actually denied me chiropractic and massage up till the day I switched. However, they had no problem billing my insurance.
They gave me a Don Joy faulty knee brace witch costs around $2000 or $3000. It was fixed like 2 or 3 times due to manufacturing defects. On one occasion the straps literally fell off less than an hour after it was given back to me, after a repair that took them over a month.
I was told the brace had lifetime warranty on materials and manufacturing. Right now, it’s been over three months of me, not being able to do my physiotherapy properly or even walk since the knee brace broke, yet again, and the clinic is not even answering my calls or emails. It’s denying me any refund, repair or as much as the decency for a response.
Do your homework. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Research them before you attend here.
If you’re already attending, talk to the employees at the back...
Pearse and Jake will promise you all sorts of treatment and help, once they have your money tho, they leave you behind and pretend they never met you.",1528300412,7 years ago,2021S05075350103.00,5350103.00

After treatment with Lokman, my tendinitis is completely gone and my arms and wrists feel like new. Lokman is professional, friendly, and personable and is super patient and understanding. I always felt a noticeable difference after each treatment session. He would always look to find the root of the issue, which I believe helped the tendinitis go away completely.

I was feeling defeated, coming to terms with accepting this would be my normal moving forward as I had tried other modalities of treatment that did not work.

Within one session I had recovered entirely. I had full movement and sensation return. I continue to see Lokman regularly for maintenance as he is an excellent practitioner. As a result, I have been in my best physical condition. I am able to be physically active and have become stronger as a result.

At times, the pain is less severe, while at other times it intensifies, leading me to consult numerous physiotherapists over the years. Following another ""flaring episode"" in my lower back, a Sports Medicine Doctor referred me to Adam, for which I am immensely thankful.
In just two sessions, Adam was able to pinpoint the issue and develop a brief exercise routine that I easily integrated into my regular morning exercises. Moreover, this simple routine has proven to be remarkably effective in managing my daily pain; I use it as a ""resetting tool"" whenever I notice that certain activities (or more frequently, extended periods of sitting or standing) cause my pain levels to rise.
I am thoroughly impressed by the precision and effectiveness of his diagnosis. The initial session was predominantly dedicated to him inquiring about my daily activities and the pain levels associated with different movements – and I must say, he was spot on!

Etobicoke,ChIJkZx3yb1DK4gRU2szteXkKgc,Smart Physiotherapy Clinic,Asif Mahmood,1,"Awful experience in all respects. I booked for physio via phone for 2pm today. When I reached around 2pm, door was locked. I saw a lady sitting inside, so I knocked at the door, she opened the door and said “we are already closed for the day as there is no person to provide the service – although normally we close at 5pm”. I insisted that I will wait as there are still few minutes left in 2pm. She said there is no one to provide the service, all staff is busy and she has been fired from the job as she demanded for her salary, and owner instead of paying, fired her. Meanwhile, another lady came from inside; I asked her about my appointment and she said if I can come after 45 minutes. I came back after 45 minutes, and she asked me to pay 45 CD - that is what I was told over the phone. Massage room was dark and sheets were smelling; however on my request one sheet was changed. Massage was fine. After massage I came to the reception and asked for receipt of money paid. Receptionist informed that she charged me for the cash rate and if I need a receipt I will need to pay 94 CD – that is the rate for the insurance customers. I was surprised how come they refuse to give receipt. Anyway, not a good experience overall.

Etobicoke,ChIJkZx3yb1DK4gRU2szteXkKgc,Smart Physiotherapy Clinic,Newmar Orders,1,"Yelp has my full review but here's the gist:

DO NOT COME HERE

The masseuses here are all terrible and non-verbal about solving your pain. The only good masseuse is Emilia, who my mom had as a masseuse and she was so professional, knowledgeable and really helped with the back pain.  I've had 5 massages here otherwise and all of them have been mediocre, with the exception of Dipti (perhaps the spelling is off) who is THE WORST. She must be related to the owner because otherwise I cannot see her being a trained massage therapist. So painful in places and then no pressure at all in the places that actually matter! And she will drown your body in oil so unnecessarily.

Reception is rude and unhelpful. They were 25 mins late for my massage that I had an appointment for. They lied and said there wasn't a double massage room which wasn't true, and then tried to make me and my mother go in at separate times without telling us that was the case. Iv'e called here multiple times and they must forget the name of their business 80% of the time because they answer with Hello?

Management is awful in so many ways. To their customers and to the employees.

Emilia is way too good for this place! Even though she's so great I will never be back to give these people my money.

I thought the owner must be more involved in running a better business because they respond to their reviews (besides yelp) but check out the below reviews for an example of management problems, every 5 star review gets a 1 hour free massage and people who shared a bad experience get 30 minutes.

She crafted a detailed, personalized rehab plan, patiently explaining the importance of each exercise and phase. After every session, she sends clear summaries with reps, sets, and helpful video demos—making it easy to stay on track.

Nothing about her approach is off-the-shelf. With Hayley, it feels like you’re being coached by someone who’s fully in your corner. She takes the time to listen to your story and designs a bespoke plan tailored to your goals, lifestyle, and schedule—not some generic one-size-fits-all approach. That kind of personalized care makes rehab sustainable and even enjoyable, instead of a chore.

I’ve been seeing Disha for over a year now, and honestly, she has been a lifesaver. I never really believed in physiotherapy until I met her.

I was struggling with severe issues in my hands (especially my thumbs). I couldn’t sleep, work, or function properly. After about six months of consistent therapy, I’m now 99% healed—it’s mostly just maintenance at this point. I started with twice-weekly sessions, then moved down to once a week, and now I only need to see her about every two weeks for my hands. I can’t put into words how grateful I am for the difference she has made.

More recently, I developed a Baker’s cyst behind my knee that left me in extreme pain. Both my family physician and a rheumatologist recommended physiotherapy, so of course I went straight to Disha. After just two visits, my pain has already reduced by more than half—I could hardly
believe it!

The pain began in early November 2023. I tried anti-inflammatory medication, which decreased the pain but didn't make it any easier to go to work. A friend recommended Mira after she helped him with his back problem.

I stopped working, I started resting more, which helped, but nights were still difficult as I couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep. Coming to this clinic was the best decision I made. Mira didn't just focus on my knee; she addressed my whole body. She gave me exercises to do at home that helped strengthen my core and back. Gradually, I started feeling less pain and was able to walk, stand, and sleep better. I stopped taking painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication as Mira suggested.

What I liked best about visiting this clinic was Mira's holistic approach and her positive attitude. I had lost hope and thought the pain would be long-term. Her hands-on therapy was incredibly helpful, and I appreciated that she didn't use any machines.

To anyone unsure of whether to come to this clinic, I can say that I was able to walk, stand, and return to work in a short period, which felt almost magical.

I had suffered from back issues, neck and shoulder pains, headaches and migraines that stemmed from those aches and pains. Which all came from a bad car accident back in 2017. I have been to a couple chiropractors, physiotherapist, massage therapist, and their treatments never seemed to stick. It was more of a bandage fix, and nothing to help be rid of the stubborn issues I was still affected by, from that accident. After getting treated by Mira, I have never felt better!! Her techniques, her explanations and thorough care was phenomenal. I was honestly ready to give up any treatment before stumbling upon Mira and her team. But I am very grateful to have given their clinic a chance. Gaining my youth back, being able to RUN, feel my age if not younger again, is just something I can never thank Mira enough for. Mira, you gave me my life and youth back! There are not enough words to describe how great of a physician Mira is. 10/10 recommended, definitely book an appointment with her, and you'll receive a healthier life worth living, with PERMANENT results.

She worked with me to ensure I had the proper exercises to strengthen my wrist and get me back to being able to do what I love. My appointments were always on time. She always had a positive attitude. Super friendly, and we always have great conversations. After my wrist is completely healed up, I want her to take a look at my hamstrings. She is so good, I only trust her to get me right and she is my go to!

My physiotherapist  told me that although I was exercising frequently, there was not enough focus on my core strength. I had persistent hip tendonitis, and it was becoming a serious mobility issue.

I am not the most coordinated person on earth, and Reformer Pilates looked scary and intimidating. I had done mat pilates classes at the gym, but it was very difficult working around my injuries. I started at Kaizen by investing in 10 private lessons (with Kathryn, who was wonderful) to work around my injuries, and to learn the basics of pilates and using the reformer. Having that foundation set me up for success in group classes. The group classes are small, where the instructors know everyone’s limitations, actively providing safe alternatives. All of the instructors are great, but my favourite instructor is Wendy. Every single class is incredibly challenging and different, but I always feel safe with Wendy’s careful eye and modifications.

Two years later I continue Group Reformer Pilates classes twice a week. At 56, I have zero pain in my body and continue to improve and level up my fitness

I very much appreciated the respectful attention, friendly atmosphere, depth of treatment modalities attempted, and the sense that they cared about my recovery.

The clinic is considerably clean and well kept, but for fairness of review, there are some small details that could use a bit more love or are of note, like some walls and baseboard could use a scrub of hand and shoe marks and maybe use a magic-eraser; the washroom keys labels could be replaced with engraved/printed text so they’d be easier to keep clean and looking a bit less gross.
The single building elevator is very slow, so taking the stairs to this second floor location if you can is often the better way to go, if you’re running late or claustrophobic.

Etobicoke,ChIJJRJq9QM1K4gRBlnJYd4Na_k,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Liberty Village,Kaitland Cooper-Parent,5,"First and foremost, Athlete’s Care has the best paramedical clinics around. I’ve been to various locations and had the best experience at the Liberty Village location.

Last year, I was working with Brian (physio), Trevor (chiro), and Sarah (chiropodist) for hip, knee, and foot issues. After receiving treatment for a few weeks and giving orthotics a try, I opted for further imaging which was diagnostic of a heel spur, plantar fasciitis, calcific tendinitis and arthritis in the knee.

I returned to Athlete’s Care earlier this year and in Brian’s absence, I started working with Lucky (physio). She has TRULY made a difference in my bodily mechanics. She is very skilled and knowledgeable, I would happily recommend her to anyone in search of a great physiotherapist. My hip and knee feel incredible as a result of her treatment and programming (the foot is tricky, still working on it). My orthopaedic surgeon advised me to refrain from basketball/running/jumping but I’m happily playing again with the help of Lucky’s programming!

Thank you to the whole team at Athlete’s Care Liberty Village! Hopefully I don’t see you soon! 😉",1753210801,2 months ago,2021S05075350007.02,5350007.02

Etobicoke,ChIJQej6oXM0K4gRxJ3A_7ERIao,Anatomica // Functional Health and Wellness,Giovana Bilibio,1,"I noticed a discrepancy between the price and appointment duration for their Naturopath listed on the website and what I was actually offered. When I called to inquire, I was demanded to update my credit card details, and shortly after, the original price and appointment details were removed from the site. Unfortunately, the originally advertised price was not honoured. Based on this experience, I wouldn’t step there again and I do not recommend this place.

***Just for your information, the service and pricing details I referred to were clearly listed on the Naturopath's main page, where all service information is displayed. These details were removed right away!

The price increase from $225 to $297 for a first appointment is quite significant—especially considering the appointment length has also been reduced from 90 minutes to 75 minutes.

Most comparable clinics charge around $250 for an initial appointment, so this change feels out of step with what’s typical. I believe my expectations are reasonable, but these changes give the impression that the focus is shifting more toward profit than client care.

Amanda – Thai Massage Therapist
Amanda brings a rare combination of strength, precision, and mindfulness to every session. Her understanding of the body goes beyond technique — it’s intuitive. She knows exactly where to apply pressure, how to stretch you properly, and when to simply let the body breathe and release. Whether it’s tight hips, a sore back, or just built-up stress, she has a way of unlocking everything. I leave every session with Amanda feeling taller, lighter, and re-centered — like my entire body has been recalibrated.

Clair – Physiotherapist
Clair approaches physiotherapy with professionalism, empathy, and clinical excellence. From the first session, I felt that she genuinely cared about my goals and progress. She takes time to assess everything properly and tailors the treatment plan specifically to your needs — not some generic one-size-fits-all routine. Her knowledge is outstanding, and her ability to explain what’s happening with your body and why makes a big difference. After working with Clair, not only did I feel physical improvements, but I also felt more in control and more informed about how to maintain my results long-term.

Together, Amanda and Clair offer something truly unique — a blend of therapeutic care that supports both physical healing and mental wellness. Whether you're dealing with injuries, tension, or just trying to move and feel better overall, I wholeheartedly recommend booking with both of them.

The pain she used to experience while walking has significantly subsided, and now she can walk pain-free! Witnessing her regain her mobility and confidence has been a truly uplifting experience for our entire family.

Etobicoke,ChIJe6MTVBNIK4gR_UGUTQXWxyo,The Institute of Human Mechanics - Etobicoke,Frank Santosuosso,5,"I recently underwent Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) treatment at @ the Institute of Human Mechanics under the care of Dr. Minhas, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. Let me share my experience and the fantastic outcome I achieved through this treatment.
Before discovering PRP, I struggled with chronic joint pain and limited mobility, which had a significant impact on my daily life. Conventional treatments only provided temporary relief, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated and disheartened. That's when I came across PRP and decided to give it a try.
Dr. Minhas was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive throughout the entire process. He explained the procedure thoroughly and addressed all my concerns, putting me at ease before the treatment. The procedure itself was relatively quick and virtually painless, thanks to his skilled hands and comforting demeanor.
The magic of PRP lies in its ability to utilize the body's own healing properties. After drawing a small sample of my blood and separating the platelets, Dr. Minhas injected the concentrated PRP directly into my knees. The entire process took only an hour or so, and I was able to return home the same day.
Within a few weeks, I began to notice significant improvements in my joint pain and mobility. As time went on, the results only got better and better. Not only did my pain subside, but I also regained flexibility and strength that I thought I had lost forever.
I highly recommend Dr. Minhas and PRP therapy to anyone suffering from chronic joint pain or similar conditions. This treatment has brought about incredible results in my case, and I'm sure it can do the same for many others.
Thank you, Dr. Minhas, for your expertise, compassion, and for introducing me to the wonders of PRP.",1695055176,2 years ago,2021S05075350214.00,5350214.00

By the time I stood up, I felt like I had just survived a wrestling match with a grizzly bear. I dragged myself to the ER, thinking, “Surely they’ll help me, I look like a man auditioning for The Walking Dead.”

Nope. I spent 5 hours crying in the waiting room like a toddler who dropped his ice cream. Sitting was impossible, so I just stood there the whole time like a sad decorative lamp. Eventually even my legs gave up, and guess what? The ER gave me absolutely nothing. Not a pill, not a pat on the back, not even a participation ribbon.

Enter Jay Bhuta at LeDrew Professional Sports Medicine. I walked (well… shuffled) into his clinic, and I swear, after ONE session I felt like Lazarus being resurrected. Suddenly I could move again. The pain didn’t magically vanish, but I went from “crying statue” to “functioning human being” in an hour. That’s basically sorcery.

Jay is a legend. He somehow makes pain funny while fixing it. It’s part therapy, part comedy show, part miracle. If you see me walking around like a normal person again, it’s not because I got better — it’s because Jay rebuilt me from scratch.",1755441748,a month ago,2021S05075350214.00,5350214.00

Etobicoke,ChIJ2YWxGSg4K4gRmTUEZl-LGhM,Four Seasons Physiotherapy - pt Health,I Ks,1,"Government should not include this place as one that they fund for seniors. In fact it should be investigated and shut down entirely. My elderly parent came to this place post surgery. I accompanied and what I witnessed should be illegal. We were taken in for a consult; we were told that my parent could only get 3 therapy sessions with the “pt” (NOT TRUE)  but could get 6 with “assistant pt” we chose the 6 sessions as far more were needed for recovery. When we came for the sessions my parent was given a paper with exercises on it and was quickly shown the exercise and the “assistant pt” went to lie down on therapy bed behind the next curtain to scroll her phone. Eventually she’d come back, show another exercise and immediately disappear again, she spent zero time observing to see if exercises were performed correctly (this is crucial to pepper recovery). After 2-3 exercises (about 15 minutes total visit) she would come back and say ok, you’re done for today. I was in complete shock and disbelief. I panicked for my parent’s recovery. We ended up finding a proper physio place to ensure full recovery.

To anyone looking for a physio clinic, avoid this one like a plague. They think no one knows what getting physical therapy should look like, and of course because government funds it they think they don’t need to do the work they are paid to do. I have received plenty of physio to know what a proper physio session should look like.

PS. Do not believe the 5 star  reviews, they can’t be real; Probably done by their friends.

My responses to the reply below; i never said that my parents was my mother. No need to contact you, the review here is as detailed as you’d get if we spoke. I have had enough physio therapy sessions myself to know what good, bad and completely inadequate session looks like. This was scary inadequate and should not be considered physical therapy. It didn’t happen once, but every single visit.

I was off of work and was completely disengaged in all of my hobbies and exercises and was starting to worry that I needed surgery on my shoulder.
After just my first visit Luka was able to immediately diagnose what was going on with my shoulder and after our first session I was able to move my arm so much more. Through working with Luka I was able to restore full range of motion in my shoulder and build my shoulder back up stronger than it was before it started hurting!
He got me back to work and back to cycling, tennis and just being able to live life normally! I am so thankful that I booked in with Luka, Physio with him was a life changer for me!",1758559778,in the last week,2021S05075350101.00,5350101.00

Her ability to discuss muscle activation at a high level made a big impression.

I initially sought Michelle’s help for her specialized knowledge of the pelvic floor, aiming to address muscular imbalances and better understand how these might be impacting my performance, both in the gym and on the bike.

Her assessment was incredibly insightful. She identified areas where I was overcompensating with certain muscle groups and showed me how to modify my training to correct these patterns—without losing intensity or load. We reviewed many of the exercises I was already doing, but focused on retraining my activation patterns to promote better movement efficiency and strength balance.

I’m really excited to integrate what I’ve learned into my training and see how it translates into improved performance.",1748087534,4 months ago,2021S05075350101.00,5350101.00

Once active again, I developed persistent and acute foot pain when walking. Over a year, I sought out other foot specialists to help. After many consultations and 2 different orthotics but no relief, I brought up the foot issue with Luka as a last resort. In one session, Luka identified the cause of my foot pain and traced it back to a change in my gait, most likely due to my balance because of my vestibular injury. After a few sessions of Luka working on my foot along with a home program of exercises, I was improving. Luka was able to identify my core issue (gait and balance) and he was able to treat me holistically from foot - to ankle - to knee & hip - to ear. Now, I’m in a much better position when walking without pain to continue to build back my strength. Thank you Luka! I am so grateful.

She took the time to walk me through everything step by step and explained that the issue was caused by overcompensating with my quads due to weakness in my glutes and abductors.

What stood out most was how clearly she explained the connection between the muscle imbalance and my discomfort. Michelle outlined a straightforward plan, starting with exercises to strengthen my muscles before moving into more advanced strength exercises. She made sure I understood exactly how and where I should be focusing so I could build strength without aggravating my knee.

She quickly identified the cause and gave me the tools I needed to address it. After the assessment, I left feeling more confident, informed, and motivated to work on the right areas to prevent the issue from coming back.",1755642010,a month ago,2021S05075350101.00,5350101.00

My go to RMT is Ivana and if I’m not mistaken, she has background in traditional Chinese massage. The first time I went to Ivana I felt a level of relief I thought was going to be unattainable. I hold so much of my stress in my body that sometimes even the slightest massage can be painful. Ivana will seriously send relief through my entire body – her hands are made of magic! She gets so deep into my pressure points too which I really appreciate as that is something I usually have to ask for – I was pleasantly surprised when I realized Ivana listens to your body and will ensure to take action to correct whatever you are feeling.

My physiotherapist at this location is Peter. He is such an incredible person and physiotherapist. You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does; he truly cares to see his patients leave feeling better than when they came in. What I enjoy most about Peter is that he will always make sure you are comfortable being in his clinic, he will assess your entire body to see what other areas may be connected to your discomfort, he will massage the area, he adjusts as needed, he uses acupuncture relief (the best!), and he will even do chiropractic work as needed. In the middle of our sessions, I often can’t help but thank him because the relief always feels far better than I imagined before going into my appointment.

Thrive Physio is a prime example of how all of the little things make the bigger difference/impact on a person. I truly cannot express or show enough appreciation to everyone at this clinic.

Thank you for reopening my eyes to physiotherapy as well. For years I only stuck to chiropractic treatments as I felt I never “needed” physio – but the results and the relief my body feel would definitely beg to differ! :)",1682613865,2 years ago,2021S05075350520.01,5350520.01

As a regular client, I’ve been amazed by the consistent quality of the massages. Linda (the owner) is herself a gifted therapist who is unparalleld for offering hard pressure treatments. Julia offers a range of styles, from back walking to foot massages, and is also very strong. Grace offers medium to strong massages that emphasize deep relaxation.

She truly stands out as an exceptional chiropractor, offering a holistic approach that’s rare to find. From the moment I walked in, it was clear she takes the time to really understand my injury and provide a comprehensive diagnosis. Unlike other practices I’ve been to (and trust me, there have been many), Dr. Wishloff focuses not just on treating the pain but on exploring all the potential causes behind it. Her explanations are clear and thorough, and she always educates me about my body and how to improve my overall health.

What I appreciate most is how she goes above and beyond for her patients. She’s always up-to-date with the latest knowledge and practices, and she genuinely cares about your progress. The facility itself is top-notch, with a fully equipped gym that’s not just for observation—it’s an essential part of the rehab process. Dr. Wishloff takes the time to walk you through mobility and strengthening exercises, which makes a huge difference in recovery.

I also love her online presence—following her Instagram page has been a game-changer! She shares so much valuable knowledge, and I’ve learned so much about different ways to take care of my body. Additionally, Dr. Wishloff uses the WOD UP app for her programming, and I’ve taken part in several of her programs. Whether it was addressing back pain, ligament and tendon strengthening, or focusing on joint health, each program has brought me significant success. Right now, I'm working through her mobility program, and the results have been amazing. Not only have my injuries improved and stayed away, but I’ve also been able to focus on preventive care and strengthen different areas of my body.

That’s when I decided I needed professional help and started physiotherapy with Devon in January 2025. From our first session, I felt heard, understood, and supported. He’s knowledgeable, patient, and incredibly attentive—not just treating the pain, but helping me understand what’s happening in my body and how to move safely again.

Thanks to Devon’s expert guidance and customized approach, my confidence has grown in leaps and bounds. I no longer feel at the mercy of my injury, and I’m back to exercising in a way that feels safe and empowering.

I was in a lot of pain and didn’t want to go through surgery, so I kept searching for other options. That’s when I came across BioFlex Laser Therapy and met Dr. Slava Kim the most respectful and experienced doctor I’ve ever met in my life.

After just one treatment, I was shocked by the results. The healing began almost immediately, and the pain reduced significantly. I couldn’t believe it.

The therapy is completely non-invasive, absolutely pain-free, and very safe. It’s nothing like the scary idea people often have when they hear “laser.”

Also, I want to give a special mention to the two amazing ladies at the front desk they’re the best. So kind, sweet, and always welcoming. They really make the whole experience even better.

If you’re dealing with a chronic condition or pain and want to avoid surgery, I highly recommend visiting this clinic. It made a huge difference for me, and I’m truly grateful",1745461184,5 months ago,2021S05075350211.00,5350211.00

I’m grateful we followed Cassandra’s advice to continue until one year of age. While everyone around me kept reminding me that  babies develop at their own pace, these sessions gave me valuable knowledge about proper physical development for the future.

Angelito is amazing. He asks questions, listens, and remains focused on finding the root cause. Before proceeding, he’ll explains the problem, provide the solution(s), and gets to work to correct it. His comprehension of the bodies anatomy is far beyond ANYONE I’ve ever encountered in his field (Pssst - he’ll be giving you exercises to do to correct your ailment(s). As the saying goes, God can move mountains, but you better bring your shovel!) Angelito will also tell you he’s not out to schedule repeat sessions unless you don’t want to do the exercises. If you want to feel better, do what he says, then schedule yourself for tuneups if needed.

I enquired about shockwave therapy for my Plantar Fasciitis with Dr. Sam while waiting for my appointment as she was sitting at the reception desk. She told me it’s not a service they provide but said she would find me a source and email me. My first thought was, yeah right, I’m not even seeing you, why would you do that! Later that evening I received an email from her advising me of her find and gratuitously provide the information. That over the top experience, as well as my physical success with ACS, put this place light years ahead of other business with equal services.

I’ve worked with Catherine as well and she is an amazing massage therapist.

This team is always smiling and the facility is spacious and always very clean. They have Crocs at the entrance for you to change into upon entering. There’s even a Lysol can to disinfect those Crocs before you put them on and when you leave too! Another bonus.

Etobicoke,ChIJ3y4ia681K4gRLGXpxGcN4QE,EW Bickle Centre for Complex Continuing Care,christine mcglade,3,"We had really high hopes for EW Bickle: after a very serious stroke and 2 months in toronto western hospital’s stroke unit, we were accepted into rehab at both Bickle and Bridgepoint.  We chose Bickle because we imagined that a UHN facility would offer the same calibre of nursing care as western.  This has not been the case.  The facility itself is clean and bright, with beautiful gardens and really amazing physio, OT, and speech language therapy staff.  The problem is that patients in low intensity rehab spend only about 90 minutes a day with these resources.  The rest of the time they are entirely dependant on PSW’s and nurses.  Many (most!) of the nurses and PSW’s have been  great, but there is no consistency in care.  They are clearly understaffed and we have had to bring a new nurse up to speed almost every other day we have been here as we have rarely had the same nurse twice.  The unit we have been placed in is new and we have had to deal with tons of ‘growing pains’ (the nursing managers expression, not mine) including refusal to transfer my partner out of bed and into a wheelchair more than once a day, waiting up to 40 minutes for a response to the call bell, and being berated by PSW’s after requesting basic caretaking like adjusting his position in his wheelchair.  Had we been told that we would be placed in a new unit that was still working out a viable staffing model, we would not have come here.  Because of the inconsistency in nursing assignments, we cannot rely on the staff to implement any of the recommendations the physio team have made such as using a slide to transfer my partner out of bed.  I sincerely hope that these growing pains work themselves out so that the nursing management lives up to the excellent rehab provided at Bickle.",1756841524,3 weeks ago,2021S05075350007.01,5350007.01

EW Bickle Centre I admit I skeptical because of the location and I know our health care system is having some challenges. The Ward rooms covered by OhiP are much better than the Semi and the private rooms at Runnymede.

The private room at Runnymede was too cold and no view. The semis seemed too tight. After both experiences I would take the Ward rooms at EW Bickle over the Semis and privates in a second. This place might be underrated, everyone even the patients seem very friendly.

There’s parking on the streets for an hour until 6pm then it’s good until midnight, you can also park in their lot, $10 for the whole day.

It’s clean, quiet, and I’m personally feeling a lot better about this place. I won’t post pictures although this wasn’t our first choice I’m glad this place turned out to be above my expectations.

Etobicoke,ChIJH09Q5Dk0K4gRJEtJgtOlbfM,Sports Medicine Rehabilitation,EH,1,"I visited this clinic today to address shin pain I have had on and off for 15 years. When I arrived, I was brought to see the sports medicine doctor, Dr Marciniak, who was currently receiving his OWN treatment, lying on a treatment bed. I am now receiving my appointment at his bedside while he gets his own treatment-no one seems to recognize that this is strange and inappropriate? He speaks to me for max 5 minutes about the shin pain (no background questions whatsoever) and then sends me back out to the waiting room to check if a physio/chiro practitioner can see me. While I am sitting in the waiting room, the doctor returns and says to me in front of other people present “Don’t be offended but we need you to lose weight. We can set you up with a diabetes specialist.” Please keep in mind I DO NOT HAVE diabetes, nor did we ever discuss that or anything remotely related to my weight. I told him I have had this pain since I was 14 when I weighed significantly less and he replied “Don’t be pissed off.” I was so upset and uncomfortable I walked out. I am not sure why this doctor feels entitled to 1. Receive his own  treatment while seeing a client 2. Speak about personal health details with clients in public settings, or 3. Immediately tell me my issue is to lose weight after a 5 minute consultation in which he asked zero questions regarding my weight or general health. I am absolutely astounded by the lack of professionalism at this business. Based on the other review in which he tried to sell someone Botox, I am assuming his business model largely relies on trying to upsell his clients. He would do well to remind himself he is a sports injury doctor and that it's unlikely people are coming to see him for his weight loss advice or Botox treatments. Potential patients can also note that Dr. Marciniak was reviewed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 2020 as “concerns have been identified with respect to his knowledge, skill, and judgment” resulting in him requiring clinical supervision and re-education.

1- Do you allow nurses at your organization to roam from nursing station  to patient rooms and vice versa with full make up , untied hair , nail polish , unmasked and ungloved and maybe to hand out a cup of juice to the patient ? Or to hold the urine bag ungloved ? If NO , do you supervise such guidelines violation ?
2- Do you consider a nurse dictating specific statement on the child to tell his parent on the phone contrary to the truth -a child abuse ?
3-Do you allow a nurse practitioner to change the dose of a serious medication without the return of the neuroseurgeon who prescribed the medication to the patient from the first position ?
4- is your organization ready for germ screening by public health anytime ?
5- if the child told you that the level of pain is six , do you consider giving him Hydromorphone if he insists on it or try other painkillers families ?
6-Do you allow Hydromorphone continuity after 40 days of SCI operation with pain level of 6 if the child insists on the Hydromorphone ?
6-If the nurse accompanied the child to the emergency outside your organization , do you allow this nurse from your staff to leave the child unattended as nothing happened , Without informing the guardian by herself ?  And do you accept the behavior from your staff when the parent called to know what is happening : the nurse told him : call on your child he knows ! And when the Guardian replied  :he does not know , he just say there is a clog ! The nurse replied : no , he knows !! Do you think that attitude was unacceptable , incompetent ? Do you think it is accountable ?

7- Does the nurse who left the vhild innthe emergency unattended knew that he was high fever (39.5) with dozens of blankets on him and room temp (75F) with lights and door closed as no one inside when the guardian artived to his child ? Do you consider investigation here ?

8- Do you offer the child Melatonine to let him sleep directly if he told you I am anxious and I can not sleep ? Or try to open friendly discussion with the child that a human being might not sleep for some hours but in the end we all fall asleep normally !

9- update on May 9 at 1:20 pm/During the removal of the long acting dose of Hydromorphone , do you consider the hypotension side effect caused by this medication considered to be corrected by a bp medication for a while till the body wash out all the Opoid remainder or you cut off the bp medication immediately and coicidentally ? And do you consoder BP ; 80/56 dangerous required IV fluids ?

I am currently almost 29 weeks pregnant and I am struggling with intense back pain and leg cramps, which made even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. From the moment I walked through their doors, I was met with warmth, professionalism, and a true dedication to patient care.

The team at Trinity Rehab and Wellness took the time to understand my specific needs, creating a tailored treatment plan that brought me much-needed relief. Their expertise in prenatal care is evident, and each session left me feeling stronger, more comfortable, and more confident in my body’s ability to handle the changes of pregnancy.

Beyond their skill, what truly sets Trinity apart is the kindness and support of the staff. They made me feel valued, cared for, and encouraged throughout my entire journey. Thanks to their incredible work, I was able to enjoy my pregnancy with significantly less pain and more mobility.

Here’s what’s different about them; I have been in chronic pain for the last 21 years and have gone to countless clinics but everyone used just hook me to a heating pad, TENS and ultrasound with very little manual release.

At Trinity Rehab, they manually release the muscle tenderness as much as possible, I have seen a huge positive change in my condition just after 3-4 visits.

I sincerely and honestly recommend them, they really are better than some of the most fanciest places I’ve been to.

I hurt my elbow last year. My doctor prescribed anti-inflammation pills and physiotherapy. Together with pain killer, icing and stretching, I tried a lot of solutions. Non worked for me. Finally A shot of cortisone eliminated the pain completely. However, about a month later, I don't even know what I did and suddenly the pain came back. as you may know, Cortisone shot has some serious potential risks which include tendon weakening and rupture. I wonder maybe it did cause some damage... That was early this year and I don't want to take another cortisone shot any more. so I suffered everyday and the pain would wake me up several times a night. Finally the specialist asked me to try  shockwave therapy and I come to Avesta.
After 3 treatments by Amir, I would say the pain is 60% gone!. Now I can finally sleep through the night! This is way beyond my expectation. If you suffer from tennis elbow, you would  know exactly what I'm talking about.  I have never wrote long reviews but I really want to share this. Oh, one more thing, when you take the shockwave treatment, expect some really excruciating pain. Once it's done, you will feel immediate relief.
I'm coming in for my 4th shockwave tomorrow. I'm very optimistic now.
updated Aug 24th:  total 5 treatments of shockwave by Amir, 75% pain is gone. only issue left is on the very bony spot which is too painful to take shockwave. I will leave it alone and start some exercise. Overall, shockwave therapy is very effective treating my tennis elbow. Thank you Amir!",1629822220,4 years ago,2021S05075350521.04,5350521.04

A referral means I have to make a doctor's appointment, take the subway and then wait for the referral to come in and then take the subway to this place. To even find out what procedures they use.

The receptionist can barely speak legible English, she didn't even know how to answer any questions, she kept repeating herself, without answering what procedures they use there!
Where do they find these people? this is pointless, how can you run any clinic when your receptionist can't speak English and doesn't know the procedure to even see the doctor?
Unbelievable.

Update; now see the obscene reply to my complaint about this clinic. Everything is deemed ""racist"" or ""rude"" when the reality is I made a perfectly normal call to find out what they provided at this clinic. There was no ""racist or rude, or aggressive behavior"", who calls a clinic to make inquiries and uses ""racism""? how would someone have ""aggressive behavior"" over the phone? Seems my initial observations of this place were spot on. Hire people who speak English and can answer questions in English and know what the procedures are at a clinic you work at, and when called out, try not responding with hysteria, false accusations and ignorance and falling back on ""racism"".

Etobicoke,ChIJI3HJp-40K4gRX8IQz0DYmYQ,TCR Physical Therapy & Rehab,Ash Anthony,3,"I started to see Dr. Manga in 2013 after a car accident. She was part of my 3 year healing journey and I couldn't be more grateful to her and the Office Manager at the time Carla.

Unfortunately, things have changed now that Carla is no longer there and Dr. Manga is on mat leave. A few weeks ago, I came in with knee pain. I was told Dr. Manga was on mat leave but the clinic had hired a new graduate Physiotherapist to take over for the time being.

I booked an assessment with Dr. Hussain. She was pleasant but immediately associated my knee pain with back pain. She assessed me and did some movements. She suggested I come in x2 a week for 6 weeks. She also told me my next appointment would involve acupuncture, and doing some exercises.
When I called to book another appointment with her again though, I was (first) told she only worked x2 a week. I didn't appreciate this as, with everyone, people have work and other commitments that can make it hard to schedule with any therapist only available x2 week. I decided I would call back at a later date. When I did I was then told Dr. Hussain works x3 week. I was frustrated as I was given the incorrect info and could've possibly made an appointment  with her if I was notified of her correct availability.

Nonetheless, she wasn't available and I booked with another Physiotherapist. What a waste of time and money. I was advised that she didn't do ""the same thing"" as Dr. Hussain which meant she didn't perform chiropractic services. No problem. But I expected more during my session with her. When I saw the the other Physiotherapist she massaged my lower back with her knuckles and then put some electro-pads on my lower back. That's it! I could've done this at home with Dr. Ho's device and get my partner to massage my lower back. She didn't do anything to my knees or legs and for $80.00 it felt like a rip-off.

I called the clinic when I got home, and explained how I was feeling about the quality of the treatment I received. I explained that the Physiotherapist didn't do much, I explained what she did and how it felt minimal and I felt like I got ripped off. The person I spoke to reassured me several times that she heard what I was saying and would follow up with Dr. Manga and would call me back once she followed up with Dr. Manga. I appreciated this in the moment.....

But now it's been 2.5 weeks, and I have not received a call back from the clinic nor the person I spoke to. It's unfortunate because when Dr. Manga was in the office, things were not like this. This whole experience gave the impression that their focus is on monetary gain and not the patient.

Until Dr. Manga returns, I suggest looking somewhere else. I have found a new place that not only charges less (and is considerate of those who don't have insurance) but has been able to address and work on my original source of pain which was my knees and tell me what is actually going on instead of just resorting to ""it's probably coming from your back.""

I hope the clinic can return to how it used to be because the quality of service has unfortunately depreciated.",1632018218,4 years ago,2021S05075350058.00,5350058.00

I’ve seen a fair few physios over the years. There are only a handful in Toronto I’d actually recommend, and Sanjay at Rehab Mechanics is one I’d go back to again and again.

He’s attentive. He listens. He explains what he’s doing and why. He doesn’t hand you a laundry list of exercises—he works with your schedule, your capacity, your pace.

The plan he gave me was simple, manageable, and it worked. I think back to how I felt four weeks ago when I first walked into the clinic, and the difference now is remarkable.

So long as you put in the work outside of session, you’ll get better.

He’s been through injury himself, which shows in how he treats you. You’re not just a shoulder or a knee. You’re a person with a life. This is reflected in the personal, lifestyle focused care that meets you where you are and works with your schedule.

The price—especially compared to other clinics nearby—is more than fair.

You’re paying for someone who knows what they’re doing and does it well, for way less than the more ""famous"" clinics in the area.

She was going there for almost 4 months twice a week, and there was very little improvement, she was still in pain and frustrated. So, we decided to stop our visits to CBI and go back to Dr. Stana, in 2 visits we could see huge improvement, and with few additional session she was back to normal herself, being able to train and compete.

Etobicoke,ChIJTW34noE2K4gR_6_5JEraSoc,High Park Physiotherapy,Mal Kau,1,"Dear High Park Physiotherapy,

I am writing to document and share my concerns regarding my recent experience at your clinic.

I first called on a Tuesday to book an appointment. I was asked if I could come in later that same day; however, I was unavailable and instead accepted an appointment for the following day at 1:30 p.m. I was very pleased to have been booked so quickly.

When booking, I explained to the receptionist that my family doctor referred me to High Park Physiotherapy specifically because your clinic accepts patients covered under Ontario Health Insurance. The receptionist informed me that OHIP-covered clients may have longer wait times compared to those with private insurance, and asked if I had private insurance. I confirmed that I do, through Desjardins, and she was pleased to hear this and confirmed my appointment.

I also explained that all services I receive should be billed under my Desjardins coverage, and that anything not covered could be billed through OHIP. I told her I would arrive early to provide my insurance information since she preferred not to collect it over the phone.

The next day, I arrived one hour early to give staff time to process my coverage. However, an hour later, another receptionist asked me to sign a document stating that I was required to pay $150 for the initial assessment, with reimbursement to come directly from my insurance company.

I explained that I had already confirmed with the previous receptionist that your clinic accepts direct billing, and that I had come early specifically so the coverage could be verified. At that point, I phoned Desjardins myself. A representative spoke directly with your receptionist and confirmed that I am covered 100% for physiotherapy. Despite this, I was still told I must pay upfront.

The receptionist even called Desjardins again, and they repeated the same confirmation: I am covered at 100%. Still, the clinic refused to honor the direct billing and would not proceed with my appointment unless I paid the $150 directly.

Shortly after, the Director introduced himself and explained that High Park Physiotherapy does not accept direct billing from Desjardins because the insurer has not reliably paid invoices in the past. While I understand the frustration this may cause a business, the repeated insistence that I pay out of pocket—despite my insurer confirming coverage multiple times—was both confusing and concerning.

In total, I was told no fewer than nine times that I had to pay directly, even after Desjardins had clearly confirmed otherwise. Unfortunately, I was unable to proceed with my appointment as a result.

I am disappointed by this experience and would like clarification from your office:

Why does High Park Physiotherapy not honor Desjardins’ direct billing despite the insurer’s confirmation of coverage?

Why was I not informed of this policy when I first booked my appointment?",1757367702,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350103.00,5350103.00

Went there only because it was listed under physiotherapists that are potentially covered by OHIP (and guess what, it’s not). Everything at this facility is outdated, old, not maintained and unhygienic. The therapist who received me for an assessment was even older and should really step down. Just the assessment took a whole hour because she came unprepared, kept going back and forth between the room and front desk, and kept repeating the same questions over and over again.

After struggling with sciatica pain for over two months, I am finally pain-free, thanks to Alison’s expertise and dedication. Her guidance and support throughout this difficult time were invaluable.

I would also like to express my deep appreciation to Tuan, who provided my initial treatments. He spent a significant amount of time during my first two sessions, far beyond the allotted treatment time, working diligently to identify the root cause of my pain. His commitment to understanding my condition and providing effective treatment was truly exceptional.

I am grateful to everyone at CSRM, including Rose at the reception, who was always friendly and accommodating. The entire team made this challenging period much more bearable with their kindness and professionalism.

While I hope no one ever has to endure the pain I experienced, I would highly recommend the Centre for Sport & Recreation Medicine to anyone in need of similar help. The team here is outstanding, and I am thankful to have been treated by such caring professionals.",1723173506,a year ago,2021S05075350035.00,5350035.00

In March 2024, I injured my rotator cuff while climbing (yikes). After appointments and appointments with different physiotherapists, I lost hope to fully recover from the injury. I booked an appointment with Heather and I'm so glad I did. The first appointment was very thorough, she really made sure she had all the information needed. From the first session I could notice an instant improvement, the pain started decreasing from day 1, I was super impressed, and with a few more sessions, it ALL went away, I still can't believe it. Heather is super knowledgeable, skillful, and resourceful, she knows what to do to improve your injury, and you can tell that she wants to get you to the point you were before the injury, even if you are at 99% recovery, she'll work this 1% left.

The receptionists are incredibly kind and helpful, they even call you if there's a very slight delay with your appointment so you can adjust, being mindful of your valuable time.

He also helped create a personalized exercise routine for me personalized on my specific needs to use to keep exercising independently. He does very good pressure point work too, and I always feel I have better mobility after a session with him. Christopher exceeded my expectations, best physio experience I've had to date - highly recommended!

In addition to physio sessions with Christopher, I've also had many sessions with Dr. Armin who is an excellent chiropractor. Dr. Armin is very personable, friendly and knowledgeable and what I appreciate most about his service is his ability to explain the issues I have with my chronic lower back pain and also give insightful helpful tips on how to treat it.

I've also seen Cindy Ramintang for several acupuncture sessions, super knowledgeable and I always leave my sessions with her feeling incredibly relaxed and restored. If you haven't tried acupuncture yet, I highly recommend her!

Finally I also had several sessions with Desiree who is an amazing RMT, I can easily say the best massage therapist in I've seen to date!

Etobicoke,ChIJZdXEtG8tK4gRgtRhM6KcUPA,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Yonge & Sheppard,Irene T,1,"I've been coming to this clinic since April 2025 up until last month. The manager Jordan's handling of my last visit left a sour taste. I highly advise for everyone to TIME their physio treatment duration, as I paid for time I did not receive.

I had previously booked a couple 30-minute physiotherapy follow up sessions for $99. I saw there was an ""Extended"" option available for $130, so figured for cost efficiency, it made sense to book that, and expected an hour given that their assessment session is 1 hour billed at $129.

Come day of my appointment, booked for 1:30pm, my physiotherapist Reza (Mohammadreza) retrieved me from the waiting area 5 minutes late. I didn't fuss over this since I figure he would make up the time at the end of the session.

Treatment goes along fine. At some point as I laid face down on the treatment bed, Reza says my time is up. Confused, I look at my watch. It is 2:11pm, and I say I booked a longer session. He says I booked a shorter session and showed me his laptop that said my session ends at 2:10pm, but unfortunately he has a client right after and cannot treat me further that day. Understanding this is not within Reza's control and that there is a misunderstanding with pricing and duration, I got up and went to front desk, where I waited a few minutes for a receptionist to arrive.

While I waited, I sent a text to my partner complaining about the 35 minute session for $130. When the receptionist arrived, I reiterated my concern, noting that $99 pays for 30 minutes, so why is $130 only covering 35 minutes? For each extra minute, that's almost double the rate of the 30-minute for $99 session.

$99/30 = $3.3/min
$31/5 = $6.2/min

She was understanding and provided the manager's email to voice my complaint.

The same day within a few hours, I sent an email to the manager Jordan explaining the situation. No reply, so I sent a follow-up email 2 business days later. She then calls me and clarifies that $129 covers 1 hour for the assessment because there is more talking involved, but $130 is only intended for 40 minutes because there is less talking. I understand this, and provided her feedback that pricing and duration should be made transparent to customers since the extended physiotherapy option does not list duration either online or in person. I also informed her that the beginning of my intended 40 minute session had quite a bit of talking before actual treatment began and that my session started 5 minutes late.

She then mentions a potential discounted session. I want to make it absolutely clear at no point did *I* initiate any mention of a discount. She advised she'd need to confirm with Reza before confirming anything. I inform her this is fine but please reach out by email with an update since I work during business hours most days.

In the days that followed, Reza reached out by email about my treatment success, and I then follow up that I had not heard back from Jordan.

Here is where this *small and what-could've-been a simple solution of just giving me the 5 minutes I already paid for but did not receive* solution bubbles into something larger.

Reza emails me saying he treated me 8 extra minutes that day to make up for the lateness. I've attached the text message I sent at 2:15pm. Let's consider this claim:
1. I am laying face-down for treatment.
2. How can I be operating my phone at this time? Answer: I did not. It was in my bag. On the side. During treatment.
3. How is it possible that Reza extended 8 minutes that day if I sent my text message at 2:15pm? Answer: He did not.

I replied lengthily of my recollection of the events. He replied he will send my emailed response to Jordan and reach back out to me.

I've sent 3 follow-up emails to Jordan from August 6 to September 4. No reply. I've been pretty patient regarding what could've been a simple solution, and even my response to the false narrative.",1757554223,2 weeks ago,2021S05075350307.03,5350307.03

His training plan also helped me build a strong, stable core and knees, which are essential for a snowboarder. With his help, I was doing even better in my freestyle training.

Etobicoke,ChIJg5y57ylDK4gRk1pyts-m928,Athlete's Care Sports Medicine Centres - Oakville South,andre bennett,1,"Worst clinic ever!!!! Went there hoping to get injections in my hips, shoulder and help with my knee. Because I had multiple issues, I had to get separate referrals for each body part I needed help with. This costed me many trips back and fourth from my doctor getting referrals. After that got taken care of I finally got my first appointment. Unfortunately they also need to make separate appointments for each body part as well (not all at once) which also required constant trips back and fourth. This issue with that is the doctors there only work one day a week, the other maybe twice a week. Also I should add their latest appointment I like 3pm. This caused me to miss lots of time at work leaving for an appointment and then going back to work. Which didn’t go very well with my employer. This went on for over a month with multiple appointments with both doctors and absolutely no treatment. Constantly went to an appointment and then got told to make another appointment to be able to go any further with treatment. Finally by the last appointment, I was very excited that I may finally get the treatment that I’ve been waiting for since I started going there. Because it was essentially my first appointment for this specific body part. I was told “you guessed it” that I had to make yet another appointment if I wanted to be treated! Completely frustrated at this point. I just sat there pretty upset listening to what the doctor had to say, said ok, then asked if I could leave. To which she said “yes”. This is where it really gets interesting! I later get a text message saying all my further appointments have been cancelled due to abusive behaviour towards staff. Shocked and confused, I called the office to ask what was going on? Was told by front clerk that the doctor (Dr Manisha Sachdeva) wrote in her notes that “I was not receptive to the information she was giving” and that “I walked out half way during the appointment”.  Don’t know how that constitutes as abusive behaviour. But anyway I immediately I went on to explain that I literally started doing the exercises that she suggested right after leaving the clinic and that I literally asked her if I could leave, to which she said “yes” and THEN I left. Sure maybe I was upset which I had every right to be. But I never showed her any disrespect, never said anything inappropriate, literally did nothing wrong! In fact, I told the person on the phone if anything I’m the one being disrespected in this situation. She went on to say “well you’ve been referred to another clinic, so deal
with them now” with absolutely no remorse. I replied with “ that’s fine I wasn’t coming back anyways, but please don’t say that I was being abusive. I literally did nothing wrong” she said Ok and pretty much hung up the phone on me. I know this has been very lengthy but I really needed to create the context. Do not waist your time with this clinic! I literally booked an appointment with another clinic already and have an appointment the next day with the promise of treatment. 24 hours as apposed to 5-6weeks. Athletes care DOES NOT CARE!!! Especially Dr Manisha Sachdeva. If she cared even a little, she would adjust her schedule to maybe an 11-7 or 10-6 shift so she can at least accommodate for her patients that work a 9-5 type job. Especially since she only works one day a week... NOPE! They expect you to take the time out of your job to accommodate their hours. Even if it costs you multiple times back and fourth with no treatment. WORST CLINIC EVER!!!",1758066153,a week ago,2021S05075350602.00,5350602.00

To the team at Athletes Care St. Clair,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional care I received from Ehren Chang.I initially came in with a sprained shoulder, and Ehren was incredibly helpful in my recovery. What truly impressed me, though, was his proactive and holistic approach. He didn't just focus on the immediate injury; he also took the initiative to connect with my trainer and orchestrate a physiotherapy and strengthening regime that has been instrumental in addressing some old injuries I've had.

It's been fantastic to go from dealing with an injury to feeling better overall and unlocking previous challenges – all thanks to Ehren's thoughtful and comprehensive care. Looking forward to getting out on the water and doing some slalom skiing this summer. On top of his expertise, he's also super friendly, which made the whole experience even better.

Most appointmentswith Kathryn and Robert lasted less than an hour, no one did any physiotherapy with me. Just used machines that aren't clinically proven to work, and made me ride a bike and bounce on a trampoline and lift weights. Where is the therapy in that??

I tried asking them about my joint pain from my hyper mobility as well. Asking if certain braces would help, and asking for exercises. But Kathryn seemed to pretend like she didn't understand. And when she ""did understand"" she said she couldn't do anything to help. ""There's nothing to do"". But now I've been referred to an EDS hyper mobility clinic by my doctor. It felt like she just didn't want to do her job.

They were also very unprofessional and had quite lazy behavior. They did maybe one or two good treatment sessions and then just decided to stop trying. And my treatment wasn't working.  I eventually just stopped showing up and they didn't even call to see why. They don't care about treatment. Just money. Robert was even complaining to me about my insurance not covering certain HST. That's your problem bud, not mine.

On top of that, it's only the two of them working there. Husband and wife, and sometimes their son. It's pretty strange, and the dynamic is weird. Like you can tell when they've had an argument that morning. I don't like this place at all, and I feel like there's something else going on there.

Etobicoke,ChIJ28u9yPZGK4gROBFiciY0_MI,Dynamic Physiotherapy & Sports Injury Clinic Inc,Brandon,1,"The worst physiotherapy place I have ever been to. I typically am not the one to leave reviews (on anything to be honest), but I feel its necessary in this particular case.

To start - I scheduled my appointment online, and they called me on the day-of to re-book me for a different time slot that day. I didn't have an issue with that, but I did have an issue with waiting an hour to see someone once I arrived at the clinic...

Once the physiotherapist entered the room, she rushed my diagnosis in the matter of 30 seconds or so, then attached these electrodes to my arm (A therapy which is proven to not have any scientific benefit by the way). Then when I asked to just focus on the root cause of the issue and what I can do to help it, she said they didn't have time to do a proper assessment and that I would have to come back at another time next week... Why should I have to pay for another appointment because they couldn't properly schedule me in the first time?? Also why do they not focus on the root cause of the issue in the first appointment?

The clinic is also not very well designed. Patient rooms are separated by curtains taken straight out of a hospital ER, so you can hear multiple people next to you and you have virtually zero privacy. I get the feeling this place is run like an assembly line, which the goal is to get people in and out as quickly as possible without actually helping them, and not addressing the root cause of their symptoms so they keep coming back...

After having this terrible experience they thankfully did offer me a full refund, which I took. I have recently seen a much better physiotherapist who was able to properly assess my condition, help me recover to the point where I am able to start playing baseball again!

Etobicoke,ChIJpVA22lFDK4gR8QjKCdmpBQg,Regenerative Health Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,Jacqueline Zonneville,2,"I’ve been dealing with debilitating, chronic pain since seeing Dr. Kings in May 2023, initially for help with tendon tears in my left glute. While he was quick to identify the tears in my left glute and hamstring and provide needed PRP treatment (which worked), I continued experiencing similar pain on the right side, which he dismissed and attributed to nerve issues rather than tendon damage. He did submit a requisite for a lumbar spine MRI and said he could be of no further help until after that. The whole time I knew the right side was also tendon related. So, after two+ years now of seeking treatment from various chiros, physios, etc. for both my spine disc issues and glute pain, I was finally diagnosed with tendon tears in the EXACT spot I flagged to Dr. Kings back in 2023. In the meantime, my right leg basically mummified in pain and restriction and my pain levels were consistently 10/10 (as a former athlete, I had to use a cane to walk last summer). Another sports medicine doctor has since started treatment with a series of PRPs, and I’m hopeful for recovery (since there are now a series of partial tears in my R glute/hamstring tendons and my body has gone through severe trauma so the mechanics are all impacted!). While Dr. Kings is clearly skilled, I didn’t feel like he truly cared about my well-being after addressing only part of my issues. I felt gaslit, unheard and left to navigate and advocate for myself. It’s been a long, frustrating and very painful journey, and though I considered returning to Dr. Kings for further care in 2024, I felt the treatment I needed was not fully addressed by him during our time together (or I wouldn't be in this whole mess).

Dr. Michael went the extra mile, he recommended a mattress that made a huge difference in my sleep quality (both for me and my wife), and he also suggested adjustments to my screen positioning at work. These changes helped me adopt better habits and supported my overall treatment progress.

Following the chiropractic sessions, I started regular therapeutic massage sessions with Lewis, a certified massage therapist. I had a lot of stiffness in my shoulders and back, which eased noticeably with each session.

Fast forward to 2025 , I developed a nerve issue in my leg call “Sciatica “, I got mediation from the doctor that didn’t help , I drove 40 miles to a “Chiropractor “ that I was told was the best, 3 constant week of going twice per week not improvement, then I remember Dwight at the Movement Clinic. I called him and the next evening I was at his office , I walked in like a “DUCK “and as I explained to him what happened, he place his on my body and I knew exactly which muscle was contracting and causing the horrific pain. After a 1 hour session of exercise I walked out normal . I told him thanks a million times, I book two more sessions after and now I am ok.

From our very first consultation, Dr. Nyguyen took the time to understand my son as both a patient and a dancer. He never saw him as “just another knee” he saw a young artist with a dream to return to the stage. Mary his clinical assistance was always helpful and great customer service!

The surgery was a success but just as importantly, the aftercare was impeccable. His surgical team and the incredible physical therapy department (shout out to Demetria!!) supported my son every step of the way, encouraging him, pushing him safely, and celebrating every milestone with us. They greeted us with smiles every time and made us feel welcome.

Recovery was not easy but with the right surgeon, the right plan, and the right team, it was possible. And now, watching my son dance again strong, confident, and pain-free is something I’ll never take for granted.

Thank you, Dr. Nyguyen for giving him back his movement, his joy and his future.🙏

With endless gratitude,

Etobicoke,ChIJow-pUvBSV0ARrVeO_Qv-Zb8,David L. MacIntosh Sport Medicine Clinic,Emmett Bravakis,1,"Avoid this place at all costs.

The staff here are unorganized, irresponsible and negligent.

Throughout my 5 years competing as a varsity athlete at the university of Toronto I went to this clinic over 100 times as it’s basically free to students. I witnessed entire varsity teams boycott the clinic to pay for outside clinics, saw someone re-tear their achilles while getting ‘treatment’ and my time was wasted.

The doctors are all inexperienced, rude or simply negligent. My partner left an appointment with a ‘sports medicine’ doctor crying as she was told that she could ‘walk’ so she was not a priority by this doctor. I had multiple appointments exclusively with resident doctors who simply could not give any meaningful help. I was cleared to return to sport while my injury was not healed causing re-injury down the line.

The front desk staff are mostly lazy and rude and have the goal to do the least work possible while making you life as difficult as possible. You will make appointments then they will email you the wrong time, you show up when they said and they ask why you’re so late or early. They will never follow up with referrals and simple will send a fax to the clinic you’re referred to and forget about you.

The physio therapists have small skill sets and cannot fix your problems. The entire Varsity Rugby program abandoned the clinic in favour of paying for an outside clinic. The track and field team is following their lead with I imagine more teams to follow.

These athletes get to use this clinic for free and are realizing how bad it is.

Simply embarrassing this is what a world famous university offers.",1755194974,a month ago,2021S05075350061.00,5350061.00
Etobicoke,ChIJow-pUvBSV0ARrVeO_Qv-Zb8,David L. MacIntosh Sport Medicine Clinic,Kyle W,1,I showed up 13 minutes past my appointment time. When I arrived I was told that my appointment was cancelled due to my tardiness and the doctor has moved onto the next patient. My only option was to pay a $40 late fee and schedule for a month out. Showing up late is my own fault - with my knee injury I should’ve known to leave the house earlier to accommodate my slower travel speed. But to cancel my appointment for the whole day and charge students a late fee makes it seem like they’re more interested in upholding administrative process rather than patient care. They also followed up with an email reminding me I owe them money and asking that sign and  fill out a “no show form” - it’s attached for your amusement. This behaviour from a health clinic is odd… I’ve never experienced this type of treatment before as a patient.

I came to the clinic after a spiral fracture in my left humerus and honestly the whole experience has been incredible. Right from the start Matt explained everything so clearly; the anatomy, what had happened, and how we were going to fix it. What stood out most was how well he listens. He doesn’t just nod along, he really takes in what you’re saying and then applies his knowledge to get you moving in the right direction. That gave me so much confidence in the process, and now I’m fully recovered. I’ve got my arm back, 100%.

The clinic itself makes everything so easy. Direct billing takes the stress away, the app helps you keep track of your program and log progress, and booking appointments (with reminders) is simple. On top of that, the vibe is welcoming and professional. Every visit I was greeted by name, and the whole team makes it feel natural, not transactional.

What really impressed me is how flexible and consistent the care is. I worked mainly with Matt, but also had a couple of sessions with Leah Terry, and the transition was seamless. It showed me that no matter who you’re working with, you’re in great hands — the whole team is knowledgeable, supportive, and committed to keeping your recovery on track.

Recovery here really feels like teamwork. They don’t just hand you a program, they adapt it based on how you’re doing and keep you motivated at your pace. The more effort I put in, the faster I got results, and they were right there adjusting and encouraging me every step of the way. They’re great at meeting you where you’re at and helping you move toward full recovery in a way that feels achievable.

I especially appreciate that the staff take the time to understand your needs, they listen attentively, offer personalized recommendations, and check in throughout the session to ensure everything is going well. Special kudos to Mike and Robbie, both of whom gave exceptional massages that left me feeling noticeably better and completely stress-free.

The atmosphere at Atinama is calming and welcoming. As soon as you walk in, you’re greeted by a peaceful energy and a soft, soothing environment that encourages you to disconnect from the outside world and focus on your well-being.

Overall, I highly recommend Atinama for anyone seeking professional massage therapy. The only minor suggestion I’d offer is regarding the oils used, some of them have a strong scent, which could be intense for people with sensitivities. If you’re sensitive or allergic, I recommend confirming the oil type with your therapist before the session. That aside, the treatments are consistently excellent, a truly relaxing and healing experience every time!",1752267865,2 months ago,2021S05075350039.00,5350039.00

Reiki was totally new to me although I had experience with other energy healing treatments. First time seeing Miss Sachiyo, she was able to tell me the imbalance of my chakras. Through her healing hands, they were enhanced and balanced before I walked out the room. I still remember the insight she received and passed on to me after the session. It was specifically referring to my situation then. She suggested me not to turn away from the challenge. It may look painful and harsh, but she believed the Universe had my back and I would welcome a bright outcome if I tried to change the elements already in my hand. That was encouraging though not what I expected to hear. So I did just that when I returned home in England from the long haul trip. Wonders did happen. I was geared up with Miss Sachiyo 's motivating encouragement, faced my challenge head on, picked up new habits to enhance my chakra balance. My life course turned 180 degrees. I am blooming where I'm planted. I love my life.
Both myself and my friends considered coming back to Toronto again this year, I had to meet Miss Sachiyo to tell her all about this past year. I'm thankful to her for another Reiki session. And the beautiful message again at the end of the treatment. I feel assured and determined to embrace my circumstances now and to trust my path wherever it may lead me.

Dr. Pires is one of the most humble, knowledgeable and professional chiropractors doctors I have ever met, especially in the city of Toronto. So far based on my experience with other chiropractors after many years of treatments and consultations, Dr. Pires was the only person who was able to help me until i underwent Lumbar Discectomy x 2. I have never been concerned about a negative review after the rest of patient's reviews give a practitioner 5 stars. Keep this in consideration and in mind, you will find your own answers.
Dr. Pires is real business and when it comes to patient care, you have gotten the best !
Stay healthy and confident!

After 1 month and 3 days post 2nd Lumbar Discectomy Surgery at L4-L5 level; Dr. Celia Pires patiently helped me perform the very first back stretching exercises!!! WOW She is absolutely skilled!!! I experienced NO PAIN or Sciatic during the exercises.
I AM SOOO HAPPPYYYYYY about it and to also know that so far everything seems to be going in the right direction!!!
I can not wait to be able to return to the GYM, OF course! on modified duties lol.
Thank you Dr. Celia Pires for existing in so many people's lives including me!
I HAVE BEEN BLESSED BY HER HANDS, EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE!!!

He has helped me relieve my lower back pain (which I was struggling with for over 5 yrs before I consulted Tyler) and many other back related issues. I visited him today with a stiff lower back (because I didn’t follow up for regular maintenance) and was not able to stand straight or walk, he immediately worked his magic and I was out of his clinic after 1 hour standing straight, walking normally and moving as usual. He has also helped fix my wife’s frozen shoulder and lower back pain. He is truly a blessing, a very kind person, makes you feel relaxed, really willing to help you out especially by squeezing in a last minute appointment booking (when required or in pain) although he is always booked.

I’ve had three sessions in total, and by the third one, I was calm and no longer afraid of the needles. That allowed me to fully relax — I nearly fell asleep during the treatment. And when I left the office, I walked out with a completely different stride.

The latter became worse overtime that it would even radiate to my neck specially when I wake up in the morning. I enjoy my job a lot  but this type of pain holds me back from such activity until I receive chiropractic care by Dr. Brian and Physiotherapist Dr. Deepali

They were able to address them and I can already feel the improvement. I can now move freely without complaining about my shoulders being stiff after.

More so, these were not included in my issues as I came to Dr. Brian for chiropractic care but I have observed that my precious injury on my left knee is getting a lot better.

Healing is a process and it’s a two way effort. By religiously following the home exercises Dr. Deepali gave me plus following the scheduled adjustments to keep me on track with my care plan, I believe we will be able to attain my health goals.

Interior design aside, The Borough is home to the best of the best healthcare professionals. Dr. Grigg has completely restored my hope in the healthcare system in Ontario, I had a fear of doctors and hospitals after multiple bad experiences but Dr. Grigg has brought back what Ontario's healthcare system lacks - compassion and care! Dr. Grigg is very thorough and detailed with her analysis and always takes her time with patients, you will never feel rushed or dismissed with her. She makes active efforts to actually get to know her patients and never forces treatment plans which the patient is not comfortable with and she will work with you to make sure you're comfortable with the treatment plan options. To top things off, she has a warm and full of life personality, I don't know how she does it!! She's truly an all-star at what she does and is so easy to talk to.

A big shout out to Eleanor, I can't speak highly enough of her. She is so kind and sweet and does an amazing job checking your vitals, she has such a great memory and will always make sure to discussed your goals and encouraging you to meet them.

The customer service front the front desk is unmatched as well and they always try to accommodate any requests.

I am soo grateful to have found this clinic and Dr. Grigg. I'm so excited about it and have already come back here 3-4 times since they've opened. I couldn't have asked for a better family physician!

Etobicoke,ChIJ_fXkYa3N1IkRYK9ieDXVbWQ,Toronto Physio & Wellness Clinic,Nick Moghadam,5,"I had an excellent experience at this location. The front desk admin, Roshi, is incredibly friendly and professional. She communicates clearly, handles scheduling efficiently, and has impressive knowledge about various insurance companies, which makes the process so much easier. The massage therapists here are amazing, and every visit has been a positive and relaxing experience.

I highly recommend this location!!!",1731615081,10 months ago,2021S05075350194.02,5350194.02
Etobicoke,ChIJ_fXkYa3N1IkRYK9ieDXVbWQ,Toronto Physio & Wellness Clinic,Laiba Khan,2,"Customer service is absolutely horrible in this place. The receptionist barely acknowledges you, seems very done with her role and lacks any sort of warmth. I had gone with the accompany of my friend and booked an hour session. I came exactly on time, only to be left filling forms. When I was done, the receptionist continued chatting with staff, completely ignoring me until I called her. I paid the price for an hour session, to only receive a 30 min session. My friend was extremely shocked by this and so was I. If forms are to be filled prior to the appointment, why not inform the patient instead of ripping off their money and time? The woman who took care of me, had expertise in her field of area and did her job well. But the customer service has truly let me down, would never come back here again.",1725808226,a year ago,2021S05075350194.02,5350194.02
